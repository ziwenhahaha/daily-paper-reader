      "title": "Constraining dark matter halo profiles with symbolic regression",
      "abstract": "Dark matter haloes are typically characterised by radial density profiles with fixed forms motivated by simulations (e.g. NFW). However, simulation predictions depend on uncertain dark matter physics and baryonic modelling. Here, we present a method to constrain halo density profiles directly from observations using Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR), a technique that searches the space of analytic expressions for the function that best balances accuracy and simplicity for a given dataset. We test the approach on mock weak lensing excess surface density (ESD) data of synthetic clusters with NFW profiles. Motivated by real data, we assign each ESD data point a constant fractional uncertainty and vary this uncertainty and the number of clusters to probe how data precision and sample size affect model selection. For fractional errors around 5%, ESR recovers the NFW profile even from samples as small as 20 clusters. At higher uncertainties representative of current surveys, simpler functions are favoured over NFW, though it remains competitive. This preference arises because weak lensing errors are smallest in the outskirts, causing the fits to be dominated by the outer profile. ESR therefore provides a robust, simulation-independent framework both for testing mass models and determining which features of a halo's density profile are genuinely constrained by the data.",

      "title": "Current Challenges of Symbolic Regression: Optimization, Selection, Model Simplification, and Benchmarking",
      "abstract": "Symbolic Regression (SR) is a regression method that aims to discover mathematical expressions that describe the relationship between variables, and it is often implemented through Genetic Programming, a metaphor for the process of biological evolution. Its appeal lies in combining predictive accuracy with interpretable models, but its promise is limited by several long-standing challenges: parameters are difficult to optimize, the selection of solutions can affect the search, and models often grow unnecessarily complex. In addition, current methods must be constantly re-evaluated to understand the SR landscape. This thesis addresses these challenges through a sequence of studies conducted throughout the doctorate, each focusing on an important aspect of the SR search process. First, I investigate parameter optimization, obtaining insights into its role in improving predictive accuracy, albeit with trade-offs in runtime and expression size. Next, I study parent selection, exploring $ε$-lexicase to select parents more likely to generate good performing offspring. The focus then turns to simplification, where I introduce a novel method based on memoization and locality-sensitive hashing that reduces redundancy and yields simpler, more accurate models. All of these contributions are implemented into a multi-objective evolutionary SR library, which achieves Pareto-optimal performance in terms of accuracy and simplicity on benchmarks of real-world and synthetic problems, outperforming several contemporary SR approaches. The thesis concludes by proposing changes to a famous large-scale symbolic regression benchmark suite, then running the experiments to assess the symbolic regression landscape, demonstrating that a SR method with the contributions presented in this thesis achieves Pareto-optimal performance.",

As an example, we derive a simple equation that classifies fast radio bursts (FRBs) into two distinct Gaussian distributions, indicating the existence of two physical classes. This human-AI workflow integrates feature selection, dimensional analysis, and symbolic regression: deep learning first analyzes CHIME Catalog 1 and identifies six independent parameters that collectively provide a complete description of FRBs; guided by Buckingham-$π$ analysis and correlation analysis, humans then construct dimensionless groups; finally, symbolic regression performed by the machine discovers the governing equation. When applied to the newer CHIME Catalog, the equation produces consistent results, demonstrating that it captures the underlying physics. This framework is applicable to a broad range of scientific domains.",

      "abstract": "Medical decision-making makes frequent use of algorithms that combine risk equations with rules, providing clear and standardized treatment pathways. Symbolic regression (SR) traditionally limits its search space to continuous function forms and their parameters, making it difficult to model this decision-making. However, due to its ability to derive data-driven, interpretable models, SR holds promise for developing data-driven clinical risk scores. To that end we introduce Brush, an SR algorithm that combines decision-tree-like splitting algorithms with non-linear constant optimization, allowing for seamless integration of rule-based logic into symbolic regression and classification models. Brush achieves Pareto-optimal performance on SRBench, and was applied to recapitulate two widely used clinical scoring systems, achieving high accuracy and interpretable models. Compared to decision trees, random forests, and other SR methods, Brush achieves comparable or superior predictive performance while producing simpler models.",

      "abstract": "Symbolic regression is a powerful tool for discovering governing equations directly from data, but its sensitivity to noise hinders its broader application. This paper introduces a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) framework for Bayesian symbolic regression that approximates the posterior distribution over symbolic expressions, enhancing robustness and enabling uncertainty quantification for symbolic regression in the presence of noise. Differing from traditional genetic programming approaches, the SMC-based algorithm combines probabilistic selection, adaptive tempering, and the use of normalized marginal likelihood to efficiently explore the search space of symbolic expressions, yielding parsimonious expressions with improved generalization. When compared to standard genetic programming baselines, the proposed method better deals with challenging, noisy benchmark datasets. The reduced tendency to overfit and enhanced ability to discover accurate and interpretable equations paves the way for more robust symbolic regression in scientific discovery and engineering design applications.",

Using symbolic regression and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), we recover compact closed-form expressions for this residual from joint-space data. In simulation on a 7-DoF Franka arm with known dynamics, these interpretable models accurately recover inertial, Coriolis, gravity, and viscous effects with very small relative error and outperform neural-network baselines in both accuracy and generalization. On real data from a 7-DoF WAM arm, symbolic-regression residuals generalize substantially better than SINDy and neural networks, which tend to overfit, and suggest candidate new closed-form formulations that extend the nominal dynamics model for this robot. Overall, the results indicate that interpretable residual dynamics models provide compact, accurate, and physically meaningful alternatives to black-box function approximators for torque prediction.",

      "abstract": "Estimating stellar masses for billions of galaxies in upcoming surveys requires methods that are both accurate and computationally efficient. We present a new approach using symbolic regression trained on a simulation to derive simple, explicit mathematical expressions that estimate galaxy stellar masses from basic observables: photometry and redshift. Using a mock catalogue from the GALFORM semi-analytical model that reproduces the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS), we show that a linear combination of just four observables -- minimally processed $u$- and $i$- band magnitudes, observed $(g-r)$ colour, and redshift -- can recover stellar masses with accuracy comparable to traditional spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, but with negligible computational cost. Our expressions can be evaluated instantaneously for millions of galaxies, making them ideal for next-generation surveys like LSST and Euclid. When observational errors are included, symbolic regression achieves a similar accuracy to deep neural networks while maintaining transparency. Validation against CIGALE SED fitting on PAUS data shows agreement within 0.13 dex for galaxies with $M_{*} > 10^8 M_{\\odot}$. We demonstrate that the stellar mass function can be recovered at $z < 0.5$, though with distortions at the extremes: the high-mass end is overestimated by a factor of $\\sim 3$ at $10^{11.5} h^{-1} M_{\\odot}$ due to scatter. Our approach offers a fast, transparent alternative to traditional methods without sacrificing accuracy for the bulk of the galaxy population.",

      "abstract": "Hysteresis is a nonlinear phenomenon with memory effects, where a system's output depends on both its current state and past states. It is prevalent in various physical and mechanical systems, such as yielding structures under seismic excitation, ferromagnetic materials, and piezoelectric actuators. Analytical models like the Bouc-Wen model are often employed but rely on idealized assumptions and careful parameter calibration, limiting their applicability to diverse or mechanism-unknown behaviors. Existing equation discovery approaches for hysteresis are often system-specific or rely on predefined model libraries, which limit their flexibility and ability to capture the hidden mechanisms. To address these, this research develops a unified framework that integrates learning of internal variables (commonly used in modeling hysteresis) and symbolic regression to automatically extract internal hysteretic variable, and discover explicit governing equations directly from data without predefined libraries as required by methods such as sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). Solving the discovered equations naturally enables prediction of the dynamic responses of hysteretic systems. This work provides a systematic view and approach for both equation discovery and characterization of hysteretic dynamics, defining a unified framework for these types of problems.",

      "abstract": "We investigate how galactic disk structures connect to the detailed properties of their host dark-matter halos using the TNG50 simulation. From the hydrodynamic and matched dark-matter-only runs, we measure a comprehensive list of halo properties describing density structure, angular momentum, shape, assembly history, and environment. Using the morphological decomposition developed in Paper I, we quantify the sizes, scale heights, and mass fractions of the disk components for galaxies at $0 \\le z \\le 4$. Random Forest (RF) regression shows halo properties alone predict disk size and thickness with high accuracy, while Symbolic Regression (SR) provides compact empirical relations with slightly lower accuracy. Disk height is consistently easier to predict than disk size, and lower-mass halos yield higher accuracy than massive halos. Predictions based on halo properties measured in the full-physics hydro simulations outperform those based on the matched dark-matter-only halos, reflecting the imprint of baryonic restructuring on the inner halo. SHAP analysis reveals that the most informative halo parameters include concentration, Einasto shape, global and inner spin, and recent mass accretion, though their importance varies across disk properties. We show that correlations between disk size and the density-profile shape arise primarily from disk-induced modification of the inner halo, rather than a primordial connection. Finally, we point out that disks become more extended with respect to their host halos at higher redshift in low-mass halos, while massive high-redshift halos show the opposite trend. We provide SR-based prescriptions that accurately map halo properties to disk structures, offering practical tools for galaxy-halo modeling.",

      "title": "From STLS to Projection-based Dictionary Selection in Sparse Regression for System Identification",
      "abstract": "In this work, we revisit dictionary-based sparse regression, in particular, Sequential Threshold Least Squares (STLS), and propose a score-guided library selection to provide practical guidance for data-driven modeling, with emphasis on SINDy-type algorithms. STLS is an algorithm to solve the $\\ell_0$ sparse least-squares problem, which relies on splitting to efficiently solve the least-squares portion while handling the sparse term via proximal methods. It produces coefficient vectors whose components depend on both the projected reconstruction errors, here referred to as the scores, and the mutual coherence of dictionary terms. The first contribution of this work is a theoretical analysis of the score and dictionary-selection strategy. This could be understood in both the original and weak SINDy regime. Second, numerical experiments on ordinary and partial differential equations highlight the effectiveness of score-based screening, improving both accuracy and interpretability in dynamical system identification. These results suggest that integrating score-guided methods to refine the dictionary more accurately may help SINDy users in some cases to enhance their robustness for data-driven discovery of governing equations.",

      "abstract": "We propose DiscoverDCP, a data-driven framework that integrates symbolic regression with the rule sets of Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP) to perform system identification. By enforcing that all discovered candidate model expressions adhere to DCP composition rules, we ensure that the output expressions are globally convex by construction, circumventing the computationally intractable process of post-hoc convexity verification. This approach allows for the discovery of convex surrogates that exhibit more relaxed and accurate functional forms than traditional fixed-parameter convex expressions (e.g., quadratic functions). The proposed method produces interpretable, verifiable, and flexible convex models suitable for safety-critical control and optimization tasks.",

      "title": "Neural-Symbolic Integration with Evolvable Policies",
      "abstract": "Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a promising approach for combining the learning capabilities of neural networks with the interpretable reasoning of symbolic systems. However, existing NeSy frameworks typically require either predefined symbolic policies or policies that are differentiable, limiting their applicability when domain expertise is unavailable or when policies are inherently non-differentiable. We propose a framework that addresses this limitation by enabling the concurrent learning of both non-differentiable symbolic policies and neural network weights through an evolutionary process. Our approach casts NeSy systems as organisms in a population that evolve through mutations (both symbolic rule additions and neural weight changes), with fitness-based selection guiding convergence toward hidden target policies. The framework extends the NEUROLOG architecture to make symbolic policies trainable, adapts Valiant's Evolvability framework to the NeSy context, and employs Machine Coaching semantics for mutable symbolic representations. Neural networks are trained through abductive reasoning from the symbolic component, eliminating differentiability requirements. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that NeSy systems starting with empty policies and random neural weights can successfully approximate hidden non-differentiable target policies, achieving median correct performance approaching 100%. This work represents a step toward enabling NeSy research in domains where the acquisition of symbolic knowledge from experts is challenging or infeasible.",

      "abstract": "Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful method for uncovering interpretable mathematical relationships from data, offering a novel route to both scientific discovery and efficient empirical modelling. This article introduces the Special Issue on Symbolic Regression for the Physical Sciences, motivated by the Royal Society discussion meeting held in April 2025. The contributions collected here span applications from automated equation discovery and emergent-phenomena modelling to the construction of compact emulators for computationally expensive simulations.   The introductory review outlines the conceptual foundations of SR, contrasts it with conventional regression approaches, and surveys its main use cases in the physical sciences, including the derivation of effective theories, empirical functional forms and surrogate models. We summarise methodological considerations such as search-space design, operator selection, complexity control, feature selection, and integration with modern AI approaches. We also highlight ongoing challenges, including scalability, robustness to noise, overfitting and computational complexity. Finally we emphasise emerging directions, particularly the incorporation of symmetry constraints, asymptotic behaviour and other theoretical information. Taken together, the papers in this Special Issue illustrate the accelerating progress of SR and its growing relevance across the physical sciences.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning models have become firmly established across all scientific fields. Extracting features from data and making inferences based on them with neural network models often yields high accuracy; however, this approach has several drawbacks. Symbolic regression is a powerful technique for discovering analytical equations that describe data, providing interpretable and generalizable models capable of predicting unseen data. Symbolic regression methods have gained new momentum with the advancement of neural network technologies and offer several advantages, the main one being the interpretability of results. In this work, we examined the application of the deep symbolic regression algorithm SEGVAE to determine the properties of two-dimensional materials with defects. Comparing the results with state-of-the-art graph neural network-based methods shows comparable or, in some cases, even identical outcomes. We also discuss the applicability of this class of methods in natural sciences.",

      "abstract": "Ruthenium-based B2 intermetallics are promising for refractory superalloys but are limited by the trade-off between high thermodynamic stability and elastic precipitation strain. We present a physics-guided machine learning framework integrating high-throughput Density Functional Theory (DFT), Random Forest screening, and Symbolic Regression to navigate this design space. This approach resolves the paradox where stoichiometric compounds like RuHf fail to achieve theoretical solvus temperatures. By deriving a closed-form physical law, we quantify the strain penalty: a 1% lattice misfit reduces the solvus temperature by approximately 200 degrees C. This finding confirms that maximizing thermodynamic driving force alone is insufficient. We demonstrate that multi-component alloying is structurally necessary, identifying ternary additions such as Al and Ti as essential lattice-tuning agents that zero out the elastic penalty. This framework establishes a rigorous, constraint-based protocol for alloy design, enabling the precise engineering of zero-misfit, high-stability microstructures.",

In this work, we apply the spline-based, interpretable Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to explore the algebraic structure underlying the baryon octet and decuplet mass spectra. Within a symbolic regression framework and without imposing theoretical priors, KAN autonomously recovers the classical Gell-Mann-Okubo mass relations and accurately extracts the associated SU(3) symmetry-breaking parameters. Compared to conventional fitting approaches, this method achieves comparable predictive accuracy while offering substantially improved interpretability and analytic transparency. Our results demonstrate the potential of KAN as a powerful tool for symbolic discovery in hadron physics and for bridging data-driven modeling with fundamental physical laws.",
