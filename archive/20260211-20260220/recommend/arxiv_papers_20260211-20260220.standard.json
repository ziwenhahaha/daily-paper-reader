      "abstract": "Friction losses in rough pipes are often predicted using semi-empirical correlations, such as the Colebrook-White equation (Colebrook,1939), which do not fully replicate Nikuradse's rough-pipe experiments (1950). This study derives scaling relations for the viscous and turbulent contributions to the streamwise pressure drop through an order-of-magnitude analysis of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations and the kinetic-energy transport equations. These relations impose constraints on the local sensitivity of the pressure drop to factors such as mean velocity, roughness, viscosity, and density through exponent envelopes and serve as a physical prior for symbolic regression. By combining Nikuradse's rough-pipe and smooth-pipe data of Zagarola and Smits (1998), we aim to derive compact correlations for the friction factor that fit experimental data while adhering to the derived constraints. A modified genetic programming engine (GPTIPS2) optimizes model structure and evaluates it based on fitness, complexity, and constraint violation. This method yields interpretable expressions that accurately reproduce friction factors across various roughness levels and Reynolds numbers, validated up to $Re \\sim 10^7$.",

      "abstract": "We challenge black-box purely deep neural approaches for molecules and graph generation, which are limited in controllability and lack formal guarantees. We introduce Neuro-Symbolic Graph Generative Modeling (NSGGM), a neurosymbolic framework that reapproaches molecule generation as a scaffold and interaction learning task with symbolic assembly. An autoregressive neural model proposes scaffolds and refines interaction signals, and a CPU-efficient SMT solver constructs full graphs while enforcing chemical validity, structural rules, and user-specific constraints, yielding molecules that are correct by construction and interpretable control that pure neural methods cannot provide. NSGGM delivers strong performance on both unconstrained generation and constrained generation tasks, demonstrating that neuro-symbolic modeling can match state-of-the-art generative performance while offering explicit controllability and guarantees. To evaluate more nuanced controllability, we also introduce a Logical-Constraint Molecular Benchmark, designed to test strict hard-rule satisfaction in workflows that require explicit, interpretable specifications together with verifiable compliance.",

      "title": "Simple Baselines are Competitive with Code Evolution",
      "abstract": "Code evolution is a family of techniques that rely on large language models to search through possible computer programs by evolving or mutating existing code. Many proposed code evolution pipelines show impressive performance but are often not compared to simpler baselines. We test how well two simple baselines do over three domains: finding better mathematical bounds, designing agentic scaffolds, and machine learning competitions. We find that simple baselines match or exceed much more sophisticated methods in all three. By analyzing these results we find various shortcomings in how code evolution is both developed and used. For the mathematical bounds, a problem's search space and domain knowledge in the prompt are chiefly what dictate a search's performance ceiling and efficiency, with the code evolution pipeline being secondary. Thus, the primary challenge in finding improved bounds is designing good search spaces, which is done by domain experts, and not the search itself. When designing agentic scaffolds we find that high variance in the scaffolds coupled with small datasets leads to suboptimal scaffolds being selected, resulting in hand-designed majority vote scaffolds performing best. We propose better evaluation methods that reduce evaluation stochasticity while keeping the code evolution economically feasible. We finish with a discussion of avenues and best practices to enable more rigorous code evolution in future work.",

      "abstract": "Cosmological analyses are moving past the well understood 2-point statistics to extract more information from cosmological fields. A natural step in extending inference pipelines to other summary statistics is to include higher order N-point correlation functions (NPCFs), which are computationally expensive and difficult to model. At the same time it is unclear how many NPCFs one would have to include to reasonably exhaust the cosmological information in the observable fields. An efficient alternative is given by learned and optimized summary statistics, largely driven by overparametrization through neural networks. This, however, largely abandons our physical intuition on the NPCF formalism and information extraction becomes opaque to the practitioner. We design a simulation-based inference pipeline, that not only benefits from the efficiency of machine learned summaries through optimization, but also holds on to the NPCF program. We employ the heavily constrained Cosmological Correlator Convolutional Neural Network (C3NN) which extracts summary statistics that can be directly linked to a given order NPCF. We present an application of our framework to simulated lensing convergence maps and study the information content of our learned summary at various orders in NPCFs for this idealized example. We view our approach as an exciting new avenue for physics-informed simulation-based inference.",

      "abstract": "We introduce MxDiffusion, a hybrid physics- and data-driven diffusion-based framework that enables efficient and highly accurate generation of photonic structures from target optical properties. The improved accuracy is achieved through a two-stage generation strategy, in which the first diffusion model is explicitly trained with Maxwells equation-based loss to embed physical insight directly into the inverse design process, while the second model maps the physically consistent intermediate representation to the final structural geometry with significantly higher fidelity than solely data-driven approaches. The performance of MxDiffusion is validated on two representative applications: gold nanostructures patterned on a silica substrate and a highly tunable bandpass filter based on phase change material. In both cases, the proposed framework consistently outperforms a conventional data-driven diffusion model benchmark, particularly for out-of-training-distribution design targets and highly constrained resonance conditions. These results demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of MxDiffusion as a general physics-guided inverse design paradigm.",

      "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery, yet their black-box nature remains a significant barrier to trustworthiness. While self-explainable GNNs attempt to bridge this gap, they often rely on standard message-passing backbones that inherit fundamental limitations, including the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) expressivity barrier and a lack of fine-grained interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose SymGraph, a symbolic framework designed to transcend these constraints. By replacing continuous message passing with discrete structural hashing and topological role-based aggregation, our architecture theoretically surpasses the 1-WL barrier, achieving superior expressiveness without the overhead of differentiable optimization. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that SymGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing self-explainable GNNs. Notably, SymGraph delivers 10x to 100x speedups in training time using only CPU execution. Furthermore, SymGraph generates rules with superior semantic granularity compared to existing rule-based methods, offering great potential for scientific discovery and explainable AI.",

We investigate whether a large language model, guided by an evaluator and evolutionary search, can automatically discover improved lexical retrieval algorithms. We introduce RankEvolve, a program evolution setup based on AlphaEvolve, in which candidate ranking algorithms are represented as executable code and iteratively mutated, recombined, and selected based on retrieval performance across 12 IR datasets from BEIR and BRIGHT. RankEvolve starts from two seed programs: BM25 and query likelihood with Dirichlet smoothing. The evolved algorithms are novel, effective, and show promising transfer to the full BEIR and BRIGHT benchmarks as well as TREC DL 19 and 20. Our results suggest that evaluator-guided LLM program evolution is a practical path towards automatic discovery of novel ranking algorithms.",

To address these challenges, we propose Sonar-TS, a neuro-symbolic framework that tackles NLQ4TSDB via a Search-Then-Verify pipeline. Analogous to active sonar, it utilizes a feature index to ping candidate windows via SQL, followed by generated Python programs to lock on and verify candidates against raw signals. To enable effective evaluation, we introduce NLQTSBench, the first large-scale benchmark designed for NLQ over TSDB-scale histories. Our experiments highlight the unique challenges within this domain and demonstrate that Sonar-TS effectively navigates complex temporal queries where traditional methods fail.

      "abstract": "Scientific discovery pipelines typically involve complex, rigid, and time-consuming processes, from data preparation to analyzing and interpreting findings. Recent advances in AI have the potential to transform such pipelines in a way that domain experts can focus on interpreting and understanding findings, rather than debugging rigid pipelines or manually annotating data. As part of an active collaboration between data science/AI researchers and behavioral neuroscientists, we showcase an example AI-enhanced pipeline, specifically designed to transform and accelerate the way that the domain experts in the team are able to gain insights out of experimental data. The application at hand is in the domain of behavioral neuroscience, studying fear generalization in mice, an important problem whose progress can advance our understanding of clinically significant and often debilitating conditions such as PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). We identify the emerging paradigm of \"In-Context Learning\" (ICL) as a suitable interface for domain experts to automate parts of their pipeline without the need for or familiarity with AI model training and fine-tuning, and showcase its remarkable efficacy in data preparation and pattern interpretation. Also, we introduce novel AI-enhancements to tensor decomposition model, which allows for more seamless pattern discovery from the heterogeneous data in our application. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed pipeline experimentally, showcasing its superior performance compared to what is standard practice in the domain, as well as against reasonable ML baselines that do not fall under the ICL paradigm, to ensure that we are not compromising performance in our quest for a seamless and easy-to-use interface for domain experts. Finally, we demonstrate effective discovery, with results validated by the domain experts in the team.",

      "abstract": "PDEs are central to scientific and engineering modeling, yet designing accurate numerical solvers typically requires substantial mathematical expertise and manual tuning. Recent neural network-based approaches improve flexibility but often demand high computational cost and suffer from limited interpretability. We introduce \\texttt{AutoNumerics}, a multi-agent framework that autonomously designs, implements, debugs, and verifies numerical solvers for general PDEs directly from natural language descriptions. Unlike black-box neural solvers, our framework generates transparent solvers grounded in classical numerical analysis. We introduce a coarse-to-fine execution strategy and a residual-based self-verification mechanism. Experiments on 24 canonical and real-world PDE problems demonstrate that \\texttt{AutoNumerics} achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared to existing neural and LLM-based baselines, and correctly selects numerical schemes based on PDE structural properties, suggesting its viability as an accessible paradigm for automated PDE solving.",

      "title": "Learning-based augmentation of first-principle models: A linear fractional representation-based approach",
      "abstract": "Nonlinear system identificationhas proven to be effective in obtaining accurate models from data for complex real-world systems. In particular, recent encoder-based methods with artificial neural network state-space (ANN-SS) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, using computationally efficient methods and offering consistent model estimation in the presence of noisy data. However, inclusion of prior knowledge of the system can be further exploited to increase (i) estimation speed, (ii) accuracy, and (iii) interpretability of the resulting models. This paper proposes a model augmentation method that incorporates prior knowledge from first-principles (FP) models in a flexible manner. We introduce a novel linear-fractional-representation (LFR) model structure that allows for the general representation of various augmentation structures including the ones that are commonly used in the literature, and an encoder-based identification algorithm for estimating the proposed structures together with appropriate initialisation methods. The performance and generalisation capabilities of the proposed method are demonstrated on the identification of a hardening mass-spring-damper system in a simulation study and on the data-driven modelling of the dynamics of an F1Tenth electric car using measured data.",
