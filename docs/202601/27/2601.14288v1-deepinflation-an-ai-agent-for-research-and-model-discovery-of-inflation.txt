We present DeepInflation , an AI agent designed for research and model discovery in infla-tionary cosmology. Built upon a multi-agent architecture, DeepInflation integrates Large Lan-guage Models (LLMs) with a symbolic regression (SR) engine and a retrieval-augmented gener-ation (RAG) knowledge base. This framework enables the agent to automatically explore and verify the vast landscape of inflationary potentials while grounding its outputs in established the-oretical literature. We demonstrate that DeepInflation can successfully discover simple and vi-able single-field slow-roll inflationary potentials consistent with the latest observations (here ACT DR6 results as example) or any given ns and r, and provide accurate theoretical context for ob-scure inflationary scenarios. DeepInflation serves as a prototype for a new generation of au-tonomous scientific discovery engines in cosmology, which enables researchers and non-experts alike to explore the inflationary landscape using natural language.

I. INTRODUCTION 

Cosmic inflation [1–5], the standard paradigm of the very early universe, has become a cornerstone of modern cosmology. While resolving several fundamental prob-lems in standard Big Bang cosmology, it provides a nat-ural mechanism for generating the primordial perturba-tions that are in excellent agreement with observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) [6]. Despite the success of the inflationary paradigm, the underlying physics driving inflation remains unknown. This theoretical uncertainty has led to a remarkably di-verse landscape of inflationary models, even within the simplest single-field slow-roll scenario [7, 8]. As cosmo-logical observations become increasingly precise [6, 9– 12], the constraints on inflationary parameters are con-tinuously tightening. Notably, the latest ACT DR6 [10, 11] prefers a higher scalar spectral index ns com-pared to Planck, which rules out the previously favored Starobinsky model [4, 13] at more than 2 σ, see also recent [14]. This result has prompted extensive interest in re-evaluating existing models and proposing new theories to

reconcile with the latest data [15–27]. In addition, con-straints on primordial observables are also sensitive to the cosmological tensions that ΛCDM is suffering from [28–31]. It is found that the proposed resolutions of the Hubble tension often leads to a scale invariant spectrum with ns ≈ 1 [32–38]. Therefore, efficient tools for ex-ploring the vast model space and confronting theoretical predictions with observational data are crucial. The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) in recent years opens new avenues for scien-tific research [39–42]. LLMs can effectively process and generate human-like text, making them valuable tools for literature review, hypothesis generation, and even manuscript drafting. However, standalone LLMs face inherent limitations when applied to rigorous scientific tasks. They are prone to hallucinations, generating plau-sible but incorrect statements, especially when lacking domain-specific training [43]. Furthermore, LLMs lack the capability to perform precise numerical calculations, such as solving differential equations, which are essential for accurate model analysis [44]. The emergence of LLM-based AI agents offers apromising solution to these challenges. Unlike passive chatbots, an agent acts as a reasoning engine that can au-tonomously plan tasks and utilize external tools [45]. By integrating LLMs with domain-specific knowledge bases and rigorous numerical solvers, agents can ground their natural language reasoning in verified physics and pre-cise calculations. Recent works have demonstrated the potential of such systems in cosmological research, in-cluding CMBAgent [46, 47] for automated cosmological

2parameter analysis, CLAPP [48] for code assistance, and SimAgents [49] for extracting simulation parameters from literature. Symbolic regression (SR) [50, 51] has emerged as a powerful technique for automated scientific discovery. By searching for explicit analytical expressions that opti-mize a given objective, SR enables the discovery of in-terpretable models directly from data without relying on predefined functional forms or black-box approximators. It has been recently considered that the combination of symbolic regression with LLMs represents a nascent but highly promising avenue for future development [52]. In this work, we introduce DeepInflation , an AI agent specifically designed for inflationary cosmology re-search and model discovery. Built upon the Agno frame-work 1, DeepInflation integrates a SR engine for auto-mated model discovery and a domain-specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system [53] constructed from the Encyclopædia Inflationaris [7]. It enables re-searchers and non-experts alike to explore the inflation-ary landscape using natural language, thereby facilitat-ing the efficient discovery and verification of inflation-ary models that align with the latest observational con-straints. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we describe the system architecture and the design of each component. Sec. III demonstrates the agent’s ca-pabilities through representative use cases. We conclude with a discussion of limitations and an outlook in Sec. IV.  

> II. ARCHITECTURE

The architecture of DeepInflation is illustrated in Fig. 1. We leverage the Agno to construct a multi-agent system, which comprises a main orchestrating agent and a specialized sub-agent for SR, coordinated through a del-egation mechanism. The main agent has access to three core capabilities: (i) a SR engine for model discovery, (ii) a domain-specific RAG knowledge base constructed from the Encyclopædia Inflationaris , and (iii) analysis and vi-sualization tools for computing and presenting inflation-ary observables. Powered by advanced LLMs, the main agent interprets user queries, plans workflows, and au-tomatically invokes the appropriate tools and sub-agents to implement the tasks.  

> A. Symbolic Regression

The primary capability of DeepInflation is the au-tomated discovery of inflationary potentials that sat-isfy specific observational constraints. This is achieved through symbolic regression (SR), a machine learning

technique that searches for explicit analytical expressions optimizing a given objective. We employ PySR [51], a high-performance SR library, as the search backend, and introduce a SR sub-agent that interprets the user require-ments into appropriate constraints and settings for SR tasks, and autonomously executes the search process. The discovery of inflationary models requires finding a potential V (ϕ), where ϕ is the inflaton, that yields ob-servables consistent with target constraints. We achieve this by implementing a custom loss function that inte-grates the equations of motion for single-field slow-roll inflation, see details in e.g. Ref. [54]. The loss function for each candidate potential V (ϕ) is computed through the following steps: 1. Inflation : The end of inflation ϕend is determined by solving ϵ(ϕend ) = 1, where ϵ = M 2Pl  

> 2

(V ′/V )2 is the slow-roll parameter of inflation. The trajectory is then integrated backwards by solving the equa-tion:

dN, (1) to find the horizon-crossing field value ϕN corre-sponding to N e-folds before the end of inflation. 2. Observables : The scalar spectral index ns and tensor-to-scalar ratio r are computed using the slow-roll approximations ( ϵ ≪ 1, η = M 2Pl V ′′ /V ≪

1) at ϕN :

ns = 1 − 6ϵN + 2 ηN , r = 16 ϵN . (2) 3. Custom Loss Function : The fitness of the can-didate potential is then evaluated using the χ2 dis-tance in the ( ns, r ) plane based on the target ob-servational constraints: 2L =

and robs are the target values instructed by the user, and σns , σr are the corresponding un-certainties. To integrate this loss function with PySR, we implement the inflationary calculations in Julia, which also provides high efficiency for numerical calculations. Once the SR sub-agent receives the results from the SR engine, it summarizes the best potentials based on their loss values and simplicity, and then returns them to the main agent for final response output.

> FIG. 1. System architecture of DeepInflation . The system is composed of an Agno Agent Team and a SR engine . The Main Agent orchestrates the workflow, retrieving theoretical context from the Knowledge Base and delegating model discovery tasks to the SR Sub-Agent. The SR engine employs PySR for genetic search, coupled with a Julia-based Physics Kernel that evaluates the χ2loss by solving the inflationary equations of motion.

Encyclopædia Inflationaris (ASPIC) [7]. This compre-hensive library contains over 70 distinct inflationary sce-narios and their corresponding physical properties. We employ a hybrid search strategy combining dense vector retrieval with sparse keyword search (BM25), which enhances the accuracy of physical noun retrieval compared to the standard semantic search alone. The source text is chunked by model sections, ensuring that the retrieved context preserves the complete theoretical description of a model. This allows the agent to accu-rately answer queries about specific models, retrieve their potential forms, and understand their theoretical moti-vations in detail.  

> C. Analysis and Visualization Tools

Beyond model discovery, DeepInflation provides tools for analysis and visualization of models. 

• analyze potential : Computes observables for a given potential expression. This tool follows the same procedure as the loss function in the SR en-gine, allowing the agent to verify the predictions of discovered models or user-specified potentials. 

• plot potential : Generates diagnostic figures for a given potential, including the shape of the po-tential V (ϕ), the evolution of slow-roll parameters 

ϵ(ϕ) and η(ϕ), and the model’s prediction in the 

ns − r plane against the observational contours (Planck+BICEP/Keck 2018) [55]. These tools are exposed to the main agent as function calls, enabling a workflow where the agent can “discover” a candidate model via SR, “verify” it using the analyzer, and “visualize” the result for the user.  

> III. EXAMPLES

To demonstrate the capabilities of DeepInflation , we present two representative use cases: (i) discovering in-flationary models consistent with the latest CMB ob-servations, and (ii) inquiring about specific inflationary models. In our examples, we use the latest LLM model from OpenAI, GPT-5.2, with temperature set to 1 .0. The 4embedding model for RAG is text-embedding-3-small 

from OpenAI. 

A. Example: Model Discovery (according to ACT DR6 results) 

The ACT DR6 data favors a scalar spectral index ns

higher than the Planck 2018 result, which disfavors the Starobinsky model [10, 11]. We task the agent to find a simple inflationary model consistent with these new constraints. The main agent delegates the task to the SR sub-agent, which then configures and runs the SR engine with ap-propriate physics targets. The main agent receives the search results and outputs the final response to the user. We then ask the agent to generate a diagnostic plot for this model, which is shown in Fig. 2. 

User : I want to find a simple inflation model that matches the latest CMB observations, with ns = 0 .974 ± 0.003 .

Final Response : Here are two very simple single-field slow-roll potentials that hit your target ns = 0 .974 ± 0.003 and also give safely small tensors.

– N = 60 : ns = 0 .97725 , r = 0 .00442 

• Candidate B (even smaller tensors; “exp of inverse power” plateau)

It is impressive that the agent discovered a very sim-ple potential within a few minutes, which perfectly fits the latest CMB constraints with a small tensor-to-scalar ratio. In large-ϕ approximation, Candidate A corre-sponds to V ∼ 1 − 0.42214  

> ϕ

while Candidate B is V ∼

1 − 0.00286515 ϕ−3/2, both resemble 1 − 8/ϕ 2 presented in recent Ref.[15] for explaining ACT results. It is well known that V ∼ 1 − μk/ϕ k, where k is positive constant (integer or not), belongs to an extended family of brane inflation [56–60] and pole inflation [61–63]. 

B. Example: Model Inquiry 

The second example demonstrates the agent’s ability to retrieve and summarize theoretical background from the RAG knowledge base. Here, we ask the agent to introduce the “Pseudo-Natural Inflation” model [64, 65] and explain how it dif-fers from the original “Natural Inflation” [66, 67]. The agent successfully retrieves the relevant section from the 

Encyclopædia Inflationaris , presents the effective poten-tial, along with a brief comparison of the two models. 

User : Introduce pseudo natural inflation and explain its dif-ference with repect to natural inflation.   

> [Encyclopedia] query: ‘Pseudo Natural Inflation model po-tential ”pseudo natural inflation”‘

Final Response : “ Pseudo Natural Inflation (PSNI)” is an inflation model in which the inflaton field is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of U(1) symmetry. The approximate symmetry protects the inflaton potential from large radiative corrections (keeping it flat enough for slow roll), while a small explicit U(1) breaking generates the tilt of the potential, typically via loop effects in a supersymmetric hybrid-type construction. A representative effective potential quoted for PSNI is 

V (ϕ) = M 4

 

,

where M sets the overall energy scale by matching the observed amplitude of primordial fluctuations, f is the symmetry-breaking scale, and α is typically small (often loop-suppressed). 

How it differs from Natural Inflation (NI): 

• Symmetry origin: NI relies on an (approximate) shift symmetry typical of axion-like fields; PSNI is orga-nized around a broken U(1) with explicit breaking im-plemented differently (often in SUSY hybrid construc-tions). 

• Typical potential: NI gives a cosine potential V ∼

[1 ± cos( ϕ/f )] , whereas PSNI gives a log-cos form 

V ∼ [1 + α ln(cos( ϕ/f ))] (often loop-induced). Source: Encyclopædia Inflationaris (arXiv:1303.3787). 5

> IV. DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK

In this work, we have presented DeepInflation , an AI agent designed for the exploration of inflationary cosmol-ogy. By integrating LLMs with SR and a RAG knowledge base, DeepInflation automates the discovery of infla-tionary potentials that are consistent with observations, while providing theoretical context grounded in estab-lished literature. It enables researchers and non-experts alike to explore the inflationary landscape using natural language, thereby facilitating efficient model discovery and verification. However, it is important to acknowledge the current limitations of DeepInflation and outline potential di-rections for improvement. The present framework of DeepInflation focuses on single-field slow-roll inflation, where constraints are de-rived from CMB observables such as ( ns, r ). This ap-proach enables efficient exploration of a broad class of phenomenologically viable inflationary potentials; how-ever, it restricts applicability to complex scenarios, such as multi-field inflation, single-field models with hybrid exit (hybrid inflation [68, 69], recent e.g.[70–72] for im-plementing ns ≈ 1), and null energy condition violating inflation [73–76]. Notably, single-field models with an in-flection point or a bump in the potential can lead to en-hanced scalar perturbations at small scales, potentially generating primordial black holes (PBHs), as discussed in Refs. [77–79]; see also Ref. [80]. A critical next step of our agent project is to extend DeepInflation to dis-cover such single-field inflationary models, responsible for generating PBHs, that satisfy both CMB and small-scale constraints. The discovery of more complex inflationary models re-quires not only extended physical calculations but also more robust SR algorithms. It has been mentioned in Ref. [52] that since unconstrained SR exploration is prone to combinatorial explosion, incorporating physically mo-tivated priors into the SR process is essential. Addi-tionally, integrating LLMs within the SR loop [81–85], leveraging them for interpreting high-level physical con-straints and modulating the evolutionary search, brings a promising strategy for guiding the genetic algorithm toward physically viable regions of the search space prior to numerical optimization. The current multi-agent architecture of DeepInfla-tion comprises a main agent and an SR sub-agent. It is possible that future iterations will incorporate more specialized agents dedicated to tasks such as online lit-erature review, data visualization, and code execution, thereby enhancing the flexibility and customizability of the current programmatic tools and enabling the agent to adapt to a wider range of scientific inquiries. Fur-thermore, rather than operating as a human-in-the-loop system that executes tasks explicitly defined by the user, it is desirable to evolve DeepInflation into a fully au-tonomous closed-loop scientific agent that can indepen-dently identify research questions (current constraints on 

ns − r, requirement for PBHs, and so on), formulate hy-potheses, and iteratively refine models in the inflationary landscape.
