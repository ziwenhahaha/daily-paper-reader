Abstract 

The development of next-generation refractory superalloys is fundamentally constrained by the competing requirements of high thermodynamic stability and low interfacial energy. While Ruthenium-based B2 intermetallics possess exceptional intrinsic ordering forces, their application as coherent reinforcing phases is limited by the difficulty of balancing formation enthalpy against the elastic strain of precipitation. Here, we present a physics-guided machine learning framework that navi-gates this high-dimensional design space, integrating high-throughput Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations of candidate systems with Random Forest screening and Symbolic Regression. This multi-stage approach resolves the "binary paradox" observed in recent experimental surveys, where stoichiometric compounds like RuHf fail to achieve their theoretical solvus temperatures despite high melting points. By distilling the complex decision boundaries of the ensemble model into a closed-form physical law, Tsolvus ≈ 0.11 (∆H/∆S) − 20000 |δ |, we quantify the subtractive penalty imposed by lattice strain. Experimental validation confirms both the predicted stability hierarchy and the strong, linear sensitivity of the solvus temperature to coherent misfit, providing direct support for the symbolic-regression-based design rule. We demonstrate that a misfit of just 1% incurs a solvus reduction of 200 °C, revealing that maximizing thermodynamic driving force in isolation is insufficient; instead, multi-component alloying is identified as a structural necessity. We show that ternary additions, such as Al and Ti, act as essential lattice-tuning agents that zero out the elastic penalty, thereby unlocking the high-temperature potential of the Ru–refractory bond. The resulting framework establishes a rigorous, constraint-based protocol for alloy design, shifting the paradigm from trial-and-error composition searches to the precise engineering of zero-misfit, high-stability microstructures.

1. Introduction 

Refractory multi-principal element alloys that are based on group IV and group V elements such as Nb, Mo, Ta, Hf, Zr, and Ti are promising for use above about 1200 ◦C, where Ni-based superalloys begin to approach intrinsic limits [1–5]. Their high melting points and complex phase stability make them attractive for aerospace, energy, and nuclear applications [6, 7]. However, it is still difficult to achieve a combination of high-temperature strength, oxidation resistance, and

acceptable room-temperature ductility [1, 6, 8]. The intrinsic brittleness of many refractory BCC solid solutions remains a critical barrier to deployment, and identifying compositions that balance ductility with high-temperature retention requires navigating a vast compositional landscape [9, 10]. Recent work has shown that coherent precipitation of ordered B2 phases in a disordered BCC matrix can provide a refractory analog to the classic γ and γ′ architecture in Ni superalloys [11–13]. This A2 and B2 strategy is now a central design direction for refractory multi-principal element alloys. Many early BCC and B2 superalloys used conventional B2 formers such as Al and Ti. These elements can provide strong order hardening but often have relatively low B2 solvus temperatures and limited precipitate stability at very high temperatures [6, 11]. Furthermore, excessive Al or Ti additions can promote the formation of brittle intermetallics like silicides or Laves phases which degrade fracture toughness [14]. Ruthenium-containing B2 compounds have recently emerged as a more robust choice. Experimental work has shown that HfRu and ZrRu B2 phases can form coherent precipitates within Nb and Nb-V based matrices and can remain stable at temperatures that exceed 1300 ◦C and in some cases approach 1900 ◦C [5, 15–19]. These alloys show cuboidal or near cuboidal B2 precipitates with low lattice misfit and significant volume fraction over a broad processing window. They also demonstrate creep resistance that begins to rival advanced Ni-based systems [11]. At the same time, in situ and post-mortem studies of BCC to B2 transformation pathways have revealed rich domain structures and variant selection that depend sensitively on temperature and composition [12, 20]. Computational tools now play a central role in the design of these alloys. High-throughput and data-driven approaches link CALPHAD, first-principles calculations, and machine learning to explore large composition spaces [2, 3, 18, 21]. DFT has been used to quantify the relative stability of B2 among refractory metals and to highlight the special role of group IV and late transition metal pairs such as Hf-Ru and Zr-Ru [20]. Classical molecular dynamics has also been applied to related questions such as diffusion, elastic response, and defect behavior in complex alloys [22]. At the mesoscale, coherent elastic misfit and its influence on phase separation, coarsening, and precipitate shape are now well established through continuum and phase-field models [23, 24]. The application of machine learning (ML) has further accelerated this discovery process by overcoming the scaling limitations of traditional simulation methods. Recent studies have demon-strated the efficacy of ML in predicting phase formation, mechanical properties, and oxidation behavior in high-entropy alloys with accuracy comparable to expensive quantum mechanical cal-culations [25–27]. For example, Rao et al. successfully employed ML models to predict the yield strength of refractory multi-principal element alloys, while other works have utilized deep learn-ing to classify phase stability boundaries in complex multi-component systems [28–30]. These data-centric approaches allow for the rapid screening of thousands of candidate compositions that would be computationally prohibitive to simulate directly [31, 32]. However, a recurring chal-lenge in these "black-box" models is the lack of physical interpretability, which often obscures the underlying mechanistic drivers of stability such as lattice strain and chemical ordering [33, 34]. Together, these efforts show that any predictive model for B2-strengthened refractory alloys must account for thermodynamic driving forces, elastic misfit, and microstructural morphology while maintaining interpretability. Despite this progress, there are important gaps that limit the practical deployment of Ru-strengthened alloys. Ruthenium is scarce, dense, and expensive [2, 18]. Existing high-stability Ru-B2 alloys often require large Ru contents and therefore impose significant cost and density 2penalties [5, 15, 16]. At the same time, engineering alloys frequently include elements such as Al, Cr, Cu, and Si to improve oxidation resistance, adjust density, or enhance room-temperature ductility [1, 7, 21]. The effects of these substitutions on Ru-based B2 solvus temperature, co-herency, and morphology are only partially understood. Experiments on selected Nb-based Ru-B2 systems show that unwanted grain boundary phases and large lattice misfit can destroy coherency or promote cracking during processing [17–19]. However, there is no compact quantitative map that links specific chemical substitutions to changes in B2 stability and misfit. In this work, we address this gap by building a physics-informed and data-efficient model for Ru-containing BCC and B2 alloys. We combine first-principles calculations of Ru-based B2 compounds with composition-derived descriptors and misfit-based criteria to construct a symbolic regression model for the B2 solvus temperature [2, 20, 21]. The model is constrained by classical theory of coherent elastic misfit and precipitate shape transitions, following the ideas of Fratzl, Jog, and co-workers [23, 24]. We validate the model predictions against recent experimental datasets on HfRu and ZrRu B2 precipitates in Nb and Nb-V matrices [15–18]. The resulting closed-form expression quantifies the stability penalty associated with lattice mismatch and allows for the iden-tification of a design window where B2 precipitates remain coherent and thermally robust. We specifically investigate the impact of partial Ru substitution by Al, Cr, Cu, or Si to determine if high-temperature stability can be maintained in Ru-lean compositions. This framework provides a set of design rules that connect alloy chemistry, misfit, and precipitate morphology for the devel-opment of next-generation refractory superalloys. 

2. Computational methodology 

2.1. Density functional theory calculations 

All first-principles calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [35] within the framework of density functional theory. Projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials were employed together with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) [36] generalized gra-dient approximation for exchange and correlation (See Supplementary Material Tables S1 and S2 for more details). The overall DFT workflow consisted of three stages: (i) systematic generation of BCC and B2 structural models, (ii) full relaxation of cell shape and atomic positions, and (iii) static single-point total energy calculations on the relaxed geometries. All calculations were organized in a hierarchical directory structure under DFT Runs to ensure traceability and reproducibility. Baseline BCC reference cells were generated for all pure elements appearing in the alloy design space, including Al, Cr, Cu, Hf, Mo, Nb, Ru, Si, Ta, Ti, V, W, and Zr. Each baseline calculation used a conventional BCC unit cell with an initial lattice parameter of approximately 3.1 Å, which was subsequently fully relaxed. These elemental BCC structures serve as energetic reference states for formation-energy calculations and also define the baseline elastic response of the BCC lattice. Ordered Ru–X B2 prototype structures were constructed in the CsCl (B2) structure type, with Ru occupying the A sublattice and a partner element occupying the B sublattice. The primary B2 partners considered in this work were Hf, Ti, Zr, and Al. These binary B2 cells were initialized with a cubic lattice parameter of approximately 3.1 Å and fully relaxed. In addition to binary prototypes, a hierarchy of multicomponent B2 and disordered BCC structures was constructed to sample chemically relevant alloying pathways. Figure 1 illustrates representative relaxed BCC and B2 structural models used to construct the DFT dataset. These structures span ordered Ru–X B2 binaries, ternary B2 solubility models, Ru-substituted B2 variants, and disordered BCC parent 3matrices. Together they define a consistent structural reference for evaluating formation energetics and lattice misfit across the Ru-containing refractory alloy space.

From left to right: (i) ordered Ru–X B2 (CsCl-type) binary structures, (ii) B2 supercells with partial substitution on the B sublattice, (iii) ternary B2 solubility structures with mixed B-site occupancy, and (iv) Ru-substituted B2 structures with dopants on the A sublattice. All structures are shown as relaxed 2 ×2×2 supercells. Ru occupies the A sublattice in all B2-based models.

Chemically disordered BCC matrices were modeled using special quasirandom structures (SQS) to approximate random solid solutions. Binary BCC matrices were generated for all pairwise com-binations of Nb, Mo, Ta, W, and V at target compositions of 12.5, 25, 50, 75, and 87.5 at.% of the first element using 2 × 2 × 2 BCC supercells containing 16 atoms. Equiatomic ternary BCC matrices were generated for Nb–Mo–Ta, Nb–Mo–W, Nb–Mo–V, Nb–Ta–W, Nb–Ta–V, Nb–W–V, Mo–Ta–W, Mo–Ta–V, Mo–W–V, and Ta–W–V using 3 × 3 × 1 supercells containing 18 atoms, which allow an exact one-third occupation for each species. For B2-based multicomponent sys-tems, the A and B sublattices were treated explicitly. Ru always occupied the A sublattice in this work. The B sublattice contained either a single B2 partner or a mixture of a primary B2 former (Hf, Ti, or Zr) and one refractory matrix element (Nb, Mo, Ta, W, or V). Ternary B2 solubility structures targeted B-sublattice compositions of 87.5 and 75 at.% of the primary B2 former, with the remainder occupied by the matrix element. These systems were modeled using 2 × 2 × 2 B2 supercells containing eight A sites and eight B sites. Ru substitution penalty structures were con-structed by partially replacing Ru on the A sublattice with Al, Cr, Cu, or Si at Ru fractions of 1.0, 0.875, 0.75, 0.625, and 0.5, while keeping the B sublattice fully occupied by Hf, Ti, or Zr. Higher-order B2 structures were also generated by mixing two B2 partner elements (e.g., Hf–Al or Ti–Zr) in a 50:50 ratio on the B sublattice, combined with partial Ru–Al mixing on the A sublattice. All supercells and special quasirandom structures were generated with Python using the ase library for structure construction and the icet framework for SQS generation [37]. The icet ClusterSpace formalism was used to enforce target site occupancies on either a single BCC sublattice or on the symmetry-distinct A and B sublattices of the B2 (CsCl-type) structure. Monte Carlo optimization was employed to minimize short-range order subject to exact composition constraints. In addi-tion to serving as thermodynamic reference states, the disordered BCC matrices were treated as the elastic parent phase for subsequent B2–BCC lattice misfit calculations. The relaxed lattice parameters of these BCC SQS cells therefore define the matrix lattice constant aBCC used in the coherent misfit descriptor. This choice reflects the experimental observation that Ru-based B2 pre-cipitates form coherently within chemically disordered BCC matrices rather than within ordered 4reference compounds. All structures were fully relaxed with respect to both atomic positions and cell shape. A plane wave energy cutoff of at least 400 eV was used for all calculations. Metallic systems were treated using Methfessel–Paxton or Gaussian smearing with a width of 0.1 eV dur-ing relaxation. All calculations were performed in the non-magnetic state, consistent with prior studies of non-ferromagnetic refractory BCC alloys. Structural relaxations were converged until the maximum residual force on any atom was below 0.01 eV Å −1 and the total energy change between ionic steps was below 10 −5 eV. Γ-centered Monkhorst–Pack k-point meshes were used with a reciprocal-space spacing of approximately 0.03 Å −1 or finer. Following relaxation, static single-point calculations were performed on the optimized geometries using a tighter electronic convergence threshold of 10 −6 eV and, where applicable, the tetrahedron method with Blöchl cor-rections. The resulting total energies, per-atom formation energies relative to the elemental BCC reference states, relaxed lattice parameters, and stress tensors constitute the DFT dataset used for descriptor construction, lattice misfit analysis, and subsequent machine-learning modeling. 

2.2. Descriptor construction and rule-of-mixtures features 

Each alloy configuration was represented using a set of physically motivated descriptors de-rived directly from density functional theory. The descriptor set was designed to capture both the thermodynamic driving force for B2 formation and the elastic compatibility between ordered B2 precipitates and disordered BCC matrices. All descriptors were constructed from relaxed DFT quantities or from compositionally resolved data derived from the DFT dataset. No empirical or proxy misfit parameters were used. Thermodynamic stability was characterized using DFT forma-tion energies. For each B2 structure, a per-atom formation energy EB2 form was computed relative to the relaxed elemental BCC reference states. An analogous formation energy EBCC form was computed for each disordered BCC matrix supercell. A driving-force descriptor for B2 precipitation was then defined as the formation-energy difference 

∆EB2 −BCC = EB2 form − EBCC form , (1) which quantifies the energetic preference for partitioning into an ordered B2 phase rather than remaining as a disordered BCC solid solution at the same overall composition. Elastic coherency between B2 precipitates and BCC matrices was quantified using a lattice-parameter-based misfit descriptor derived directly from relaxed DFT lattice constants. For each Ru-based B2 structure, the relaxed cubic lattice parameter aB2 was extracted. For each BCC matrix composition, the relaxed lattice parameter aBCC was obtained from the corresponding BCC SQS calculation. The coherent lattice misfit was defined using the symmetric form 

δ = 2 (aB2 − aBCC )

aB2 + aBCC 

, (2) which is widely used in experimental and computational studies of coherent BCC–B2 systems. Equation (2) treats the BCC matrix as the elastic parent phase and captures both the magnitude and sign of the misfit, which are relevant for elastic strain energy, coherency loss, and precipitate morphology. To systematically evaluate matrix–precipitate compatibility, each B2 structure was paired with every BCC matrix composition, forming a cartesian product of B2–BCC combina-tions. The misfit δ defined in Eq. (2) was evaluated for every pair using their respective relaxed lattice parameters. This approach enables direct comparison of a given B2 phase across a wide 5range of candidate BCC matrices and mirrors the design logic employed in experimental studies of Ru-based B2 precipitates. Additional composition-resolved descriptors were retained for use in machine-learning models, including the B2 valence electron concentration and selected rule-of-mixtures quantities derived from the B2 chemistry. All descriptors were standardized prior to model training using z-score normalization based on the mean and standard deviation of the train-ing dataset. 

2.3. Data filtering and ML model training 

Three regression models were evaluated to learn the mapping between DFT-derived descriptors and formation-energy-based stability metrics: Gaussian process regression (GPR) [38], support vector regression (SVR) [39], and random forest regression (RFR) [40]. All models were trained and validated using the same filtered dataset, the same feature set, and the same composition-aware data splitting protocol described above. This ensures that performance differences arise from model behavior rather than data leakage or feature selection. Fig. 2 summarizes the comparative performance of the three models. Fig. 2(a), (d), and (g) show parity plots between DFT formation energies and model predictions for Gaussian process regression, support vector regression, and random forest regression, respectively. All three mod-els achieve high predictive accuracy. Gaussian process regression yields a mean absolute error of approximately 0.04 eV/atom with an r2 value of about 0.95 (Fig. 2(a)). Support vector regres-sion shows slightly larger scatter, with a mean absolute error near 0.06 eV/atom and r2 ≈ 0.94 (Fig. 2(d)). Random forest regression achieves the highest overall r2 value of approximately 0.97, with a mean absolute error comparable to SVR at about 0.06 eV/atom (Fig. 2(g)). Uncertainty behavior was analyzed to assess model robustness. Fig. 2(b), (e), and (h) show scatter plots of absolute prediction error versus normalized predictive uncertainty for GPR, SVR, and RFR, respectively. Gaussian process regression exhibits a clear correlation between predicted uncertainty and actual error (Fig. 2(b)), indicating well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. Support vector regression and random forest models require bootstrap resampling to estimate uncertainty. In both cases, the normalized uncertainty remains small for most samples, but isolated points with larger errors are observed (Fig. 2(e), (h)). This behavior reflects the limited amount of training data in chemically sparse regions of the composition space. Fig. 2(c), (f), and (i) show uncertainty-aware predictions plotted against the sorted target val-ues. For all models, the predicted mean tracks the DFT trend closely across the full energy range. Gaussian process regression produces smooth confidence intervals but shows occasional large un-certainty spikes at the edges of the data distribution (Fig. 2(c)). Support vector regression shows broader and less structured confidence bands (Fig. 2(f)). Random forest regression yields stable and narrow confidence intervals across most of the dataset, with localized widening only where data density is low (Fig. 2(i)). Although Gaussian process regression provides the lowest mean absolute error and physically meaningful uncertainty estimates, its performance depends sensitively on kernel choice and noise regularization. In addition, Gaussian process training scales poorly with dataset size and becomes numerically unstable when extended to larger composition sets. Support vector regression is robust but shows reduced accuracy and less reliable uncertainty behavior for extrapolative compositions. Random forest regression was therefore selected as the primary model for subsequent analysis. It provides the most stable balance between predictive accuracy, robustness to noisy descriptors, and scalability to larger datasets. Its ensemble nature captures nonlinear interactions between misfit, 6chemistry, and formation energy without requiring explicit kernel assumptions. Importantly, its predictions remain stable under composition-aware data splits, which is essential for mapping substitution trends and constructing reliable design spaces (see Supplementary Material Section S2 for detailed hyperparameter optimization).

In all cases, formation energies are reported in eV/atom and confidence intervals are derived from model-specific uncertainty estimates. 

2.4. Physics-guided symbolic regression of solvus temperature with misfit constraints 

The stability of ordered B2 precipitates in refractory BCC alloys arises from a balance between thermodynamic driving forces for ordering and elastic penalties associated with lattice misfit. In this work, we formulate the solvus temperature as a physics-guided regression problem. The dom-inant contribution comes from a DFT-derived enthalpic scale and the configurational entropy of 7mixing. Lattice misfit provides an additional constraint that limits the stability of coherent B2 phases. To ensure that the model reflects these physical considerations, we construct descriptors di-rectly from first-principles calculations. These include the absolute formation-energy difference between BCC and B2 phases, the exact ideal configurational entropy computed from alloy com-positions, and the BCC–B2 lattice misfit. This approach captures the main features of mean-field order–disorder theory while allowing elastic effects to modify the predictions. Symbolic regression is then applied in a staged and physics-guided manner to derive an interpretable solvus relation. We first examine a purely thermodynamic expression, 

T (0) 

> solvus

= a ∆H

∆Smix 

, (3) which represents the leading-order enthalpy–entropy balance. This expression consistently over-estimates stability for alloys that possess large lattice mismatch, and the limitation motivates the introduction of a misfit penalty. We therefore modify the target to 

T (1) 

> solvus

= a ∆H

∆Smix 

− b δ , (4) where δ is the absolute BCC–B2 misfit, and the constants a and b calibrate the scale to experimen-tally relevant temperatures. To prevent the symbolic regression from producing unphysical expressions, we restrict the operator set to simple algebraic forms and limit the feature space to thermodynamic and misfit-related quantities. We then provide higher-order misfit terms and strain-energy-like combinations, 

Tsolvus = f

 ∆H

∆Smix 

, δ , δ 2, δ 2

∆Smix 



, (5) so that the algorithm can refine the relation in a controlled manner. The resulting expressions show a consistent pattern: the thermodynamic ratio forms the backbone of the solvus temperature, and the misfit terms act as subtractive corrections whose influence increases with lattice strain. This progression shows that thermodynamics alone cannot explain high-temperature B2 stability, and that elastic compatibility must also be included. Symbolic expressions serve as interpretable filters for alloy design. We explore the design space by screening compositions using both the predicted solvus temperature and the lattice misfit. In this way we identify Ru-containing B2 systems that combine strong thermodynamic stabilization with acceptable coherency against the parent BCC matrix. Solvus temperature and misfit therefore operate as coupled design constraints rather than independent metrics. This combined strategy is consistent with recent symbolic-regression studies that seek compact analytical relations for other temperature-dependent material transitions, and it provides a clear route for narrowing the refractory-alloy search space to compositions that satisfy energetic, entropic, and elastic require-ments for B2 stability. 

3. Results 

3.1. DFT formation energetics of BCC and B2 structures 

Density functional theory calculations establish a consistent energetic baseline for comparing the stability of chemically disordered BCC matrices and ordered Ru based B2 structures. All for-mation energies are reported on a per atom basis relative to the elemental BCC reference states 8defined in Section 2.1. All pure refractory elements considered in this study, including Nb, Mo, Ta, W, V, Hf, Zr, and Ti, relax to stable BCC structures. Their equilibrium lattice parameters and cohesive trends agree with established first principles benchmarks. Binary and multicomponent BCC matrices show smooth and monotonic variation of formation energy with composition. This behavior indicates that the structure generation and relaxation workflow does not introduce artifi-cial ordering. Increasing the concentration of Mo or W lowers the BCC formation energy because these elements have high cohesive energies. Increasing the concentration of V or Ta raises the for-mation energy slightly while preserving overall stability. Representative examples from the BCC and B2 dataset are listed in Table 1. The complete dataset derived from the CSV file is provided in the Supplementary Information.

The Ru based B2 binaries show the most negative formation energies and relaxed lattice parameters in the range of 3.1–3.3 Å. These systems represent the strongest ordering tendency and therefore provide the nat-ural baseline for evaluating destabilization caused by alloying. B2 structures containing a mixture of a primary B2 former and a refractory matrix element on the B site show moderate increases in formation energy. B2 structures with partial substitution of Ru on the A site by Al, Cu, Cr, or Si show more pronounced energetic penalties. These representative values capture the same hierar-chy observed in the full dataset. To visualize these energetic trends in more detail, Fig. 3(a) shows a structure stability map where the horizontal axis corresponds to the relaxed B2 lattice parameter and the vertical axis corresponds to the DFT formation energy. Each point is colored by the Ru atomic fraction on the A sublattice. The stable Ru rich binaries cluster near formation energies of approximately −1.0 eV/atom and lattice parameters between 3.1 and 3.3 Å. This region defines the chemical and structural window that favors strong B2 ordering. Systems with larger lattice pa-rameters or higher formation energies correspond to B site mixed or A site substituted chemistries. These points form a clear upward trend that reflects the substitution induced destabilization. The annotation labelled “Substitution Penalty” in Fig. 3(a) highlights this systematic energetic shift. Figure 3(b) further summarizes the formation energy distributions by chemical category. The cat-egories “HfRu (Binary)”, “ZrRu (Binary)”, and “TiRu (Binary)” correspond to the ideal Ru based 9B2 binaries that define the stability baseline. The category “Refractory Mix (B-site)” contains structures where the B sublattice includes a mixture of a primary B2 former and a refractory ele-ment such as Nb, Mo, Ta, or W. These systems show moderate increases in formation energy. The categories “Ru-Al (A-site)”, “Ru-Cu (A-site)”, “Ru-Cr (A-site)”, and “Ru-Si (A-site)” correspond to A site substitution of Ru. These classes show progressively higher formation energies, with Cr and Si substitution producing the largest destabilizing effects. Together these results establish a clear hierarchy of B2 stability that spans BCC matrices, Ru rich B2 binaries, B site mixed B2 structures, and A site substituted B2 variants. This hierarchy provides the thermodynamic foun-dation for the lattice misfit descriptors and symbolic regression model developed in the sections that follow. The systematic increase in formation energy with chemical substitution supports the interpretation of reduced B2 solvus temperature and reduced coherency in Ru lean compositions.

3.2. Interplay between thermodynamic stability and lattice misfit 

The stability of Ru-based B2 precipitates in refractory matrices depends not only on their intrin-sic formation energies but also on their lattice coherency with the surrounding BCC solid solution. To quantify this interplay, Fig. 4 plots the DFT-calculated B2 formation energies against the cor-responding coherent lattice misfit δ for representative Ru–Hf, Ru–Zr, Ru–Ti, and Ru–Al systems. This view highlights how chemical substitution simultaneously modifies both energetic stability and structural compatibility. Across the dataset, the Ru–Hf, Ru–Zr, and Ru–Ti systems span a broad yet well-defined range of misfit values centered near δ = 0. These families cluster within a stability window between 0 and approximately −1.2 eV/atom, indicating that their intrinsic or-dering tendencies are sufficiently strong to support long-lived B2 precipitates. The continuous distribution of points across the zero-misfit line reflects the sensitivity of the B2 lattice parameter to targeted alloying on either the A or B sublattice. In particular, the Ru–Hf and Ru–Zr popula-tions show numerous compositions that fall very close to δ ≈ 0, suggesting substantial flexibility for coherency tuning through controlled additions of matrix elements such as Nb, Ta, or Mo. This tunability is consistent with experimental observations that these systems can maintain coherent B2 precipitates across wide processing windows. The Ru–Al compositions, shown for compari-son, illustrate the opposite limitation. Although these structures can achieve moderate formation 10 energies, their misfit magnitudes remain significantly displaced from the coherent regime. This behavior explains the weaker tendency of Ru–Al systems to maintain B2 precipitates within BCC refractory matrices, a trend also highlighted in prior experimental studies of Ru-containing refrac-tory alloys. Overall, Fig. 4 demonstrates that viable strengthening phases require a concurrent balance of thermodynamic driving force and lattice compatibility. Energies that are too shallow promote dissolution, whereas energies that are too deep often correlate with excessive misfit and loss of coherency. The machine-learning model developed in Section 3.3 explicitly incorporates these coupled descriptors, using the joint dependence of solvus temperature on both formation energy and misfit to map stability limits across multicomponent BCC–B2 design spaces.

Symbols correspond to distinct chemical families, including Ru–Hf, Ru–Zr, Ru–Ti, and Ru–Al. The distribution illus-trates the coupled nature of thermodynamic stability and lattice coherency, with Ru–Hf and Ru–Zr systems spanning the vicinity of zero misfit, while Ru–Al compositions exhibit significantly larger mismatch.

3.3. Machine-learning optimization of the BCC–B2 design space 

Machine learning provides a practical route to extend the DFT-based screening from Sec-tion 3.2 to the much larger compositional degrees of freedom required for alloy design. The random forest (RF) model established in Section 2.3 is applied here to map the multidimensional relationships between composition, lattice coherency, and thermodynamic stability. The parity be-haviour for misfit shown in Fig. 5(a) confirms that the RF model reproduces DFT-level trends with sufficient fidelity for high-throughput exploration of the design space. Using this surrogate, we evaluate the predicted formation energy and misfit across all candidate matrix–B2 combinations. 11 The resulting design map in Fig. 5(b) reveals a compact region of favourable solutions centred near zero misfit, with compositions falling inside the ±1% interval forming the most coherent class of candidates and those within ±2% remaining viable for controlled precipitation at elevated tem-peratures. This behaviour aligns with the design rules discussed for Ru-based systems in earlier sections of the manuscript and highlights which regions of the design space permit both stability and coherency. The classification of this space into chemically meaningful groups is shown in Fig. 5(c), where RuTi, RuHf, and RuAl exhibit distinct patterns in misfit and predicted stability. RuTi occupies the central coherent domain and therefore provides the largest set of compositions capable of disso-lution and reprecipitation processing. RuHf populates a narrower but deeper energetic minimum, consistent with its exceptional high-temperature stability reported in experimental studies, while RuAl distributions tend to shift toward higher misfit values and reduced coherence. To clarify the drivers behind these trends, SHAP analysis is applied in Fig. 5(d). The dominant features control-ling misfit are the intrinsic B2 descriptors, including the relative size contrast, mixing behaviour, and electronic contributions within the B2 sublattice, which agrees with the experimentally ob-served sensitivity of the coherent strain to the B2 chemistry rather than to minor changes in the refractory matrix. These contributions collectively explain the separation of the three B2 branches and establish the mechanistic basis for the RF predictions. Finally, Fig. 5(e) maps the geometric compatibility of the design space by plotting the precip-itate lattice parameter ( aB2) against the matrix lattice parameter ( aBCC ). The distinct clustering of low-misfit systems (dark purple) within the diagonal coherence band reinforces the stability trends identified in Fig. 5(b)–(d) and confirms that the favorable compositions screened by the RF model satisfy the necessary geometric conditions for lattice matching. This alignment between the precip-itate and matrix dimensions provides confidence that the selected candidates—particularly those with reduced Ru content—will maintain coherent interfaces during experimental validation. The rigorous structural constraints revealed in Fig. 5 thus motivate the more explicit examination of the functional form underlying these trends, which is addressed in the next section through symbolic regression. 12 Figure 5: Machine-learning optimization of the BCC–B2 design space.

The RF settings used to produce Fig. 5(a,b) were selected to balance predictive accuracy and sta-bility across energy and misfit targets, and their performance under randomized cross validation is summarized in Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 5(a) the tuned RF reproduces DFT misfit with high fidelity, and Fig. 5(b) demonstrates that the same model locates a compact, physically meaningful design window near zero misfit. In Fig. 6(a,b) the scattered distribution of cross-validated errors reflects the variability that arises when the RF ensemble size, tree depth and feature sampling are perturbed. The tuned model is located at the lower bound of these distributions, and most sampled configurations fall within similar error ranges, indicating that the overall structure of the misfit and formation-energy landscape is robust to moderate hyperparameter changes. The small fluctuations seen across the grid search motivate the use of both the primary ( ±1%) and secondary ( ±2%) design windows in Fig. 5(b), which ensures that conclusions regarding coherent and near-coherent candidate regions remain stable under reasonable model perturbations. We therefore report the grid-search diagnostics in the Supplementary Information and include the tuned model artifacts and CSV outputs as supplementary material; nevertheless, readers should note that small shifts in model settings or adopting a different algorithm family (for example XGBoost, Bayesian optimiza-tion or SVR) and, more importantly, changing the matrix chemistries under consideration, can shift the numerical boundaries of the design windows. For these reasons we rely on the physics-derived descriptors and consistency checks against relaxed DFT lattice parameters when interpreting the RF-guided map; the next section uses symbolic regression to extract compact analytic relations that summarize those physics-constrained trends and to test their stability across resampling. 13 Figure 6: Grid-search validation of RF hyperparameter choices.

The red marker denotes the best cross-validation sample selected for the tuned RF used in this work. 

3.4. Symbolic Regression Formulation of Coherent Stability 

RF surrogate developed in Section 3.3 identifies a narrow and physically meaningful region of the BCC–B2 design space in which strong thermodynamic driving force coexists with low lat-tice misfit. In particular, the RF model reveals that high solvus stability is confined to a compact coherency-controlled domain, consistent with experimental observations of coherent Ru-based B2 precipitation. While the RF reliably maps this stability landscape, its ensemble-based architecture does not yield an explicit functional relationship between thermodynamic stabilization and elastic compatibility. To extract such a relationship and to rationalize the structure of the RF-predicted stability surface, we apply symbolic regression (SR) to the RF-screened dataset. The SR analysis follows the physics-guided formulation introduced in Section 2.4. The regression was constrained to operate on descriptors with direct thermodynamic or elastic meaning, namely the enthalpy– entropy ratio ∆H/∆Smix and the coherent lattice misfit δ . To ensure that higher-order elastic ef-fects were not artificially excluded, the feature set explicitly included nonlinear misfit descriptors such as δ 2, δ 3, and strain-energy-like combinations (e.g., δ 2/∆Smix ). Unary operators allowing squaring and cubing were enabled during the search, and parsimony penalties were deliberately kept low, allowing complex expressions to persist where they provided meaningful improvement in predictive fidelity. Across extensive symbolic regression runs and inspection of the hall-of-fame solutions, the regression consistently converged to a form that explicitly decouples thermodynamic and elastic contributions. The resulting expression, given in Eq. (6), expresses the solvus temperature Tsolvus 

as a direct competition between a thermodynamic ordering term and an elastic coherency penalty: 

Tsolvus = 0.1121 

 ∆H

∆Smix 



− 20000 |δ |. (6) Here, ∆H represents the DFT-calculated formation enthalpy difference between the ordered B2 and disordered BCC states, ∆Smix is the configurationally exact mixing entropy, and δ is the co-herent lattice misfit strain. The first term defines an effective thermodynamic temperature scale corresponding to the theoretical upper bound for B2 stability in the absence of elastic constraints. The second term imposes a strictly subtractive elastic penalty that suppresses the observable solvus temperature as coherency deteriorates. The structure and implications of Eq. 6 are illustrated in 14 Fig. 7(a). The contour map shows the predicted solvus temperature as a joint function of ther-modynamic driving force and lattice misfit. Two features are immediately apparent. First, the iso-stability contours are approximately linear in δ , producing diagonal bands rather than curved or parabolic boundaries. Second, the high-temperature region collapses rapidly with increasing misfit, even at large ∆H/∆Smix , demonstrating that strong thermodynamic driving force alone is insufficient to sustain high solvus stability in the presence of elastic incompatibility. The dashed line in Fig. 7(a), marking a representative coherency limit of approximately 2%, highlights that the design space supporting solvus temperatures above ∼1500 ◦C is confined to a narrow misfit window. Figure 7(b) provides a complementary representation by fixing the lattice misfit and examin-ing the solvus temperature as a function of thermodynamic driving force. The resulting families of straight, approximately parallel lines correspond to constant-misfit slices through the stability surface. The uniform vertical separation between these lines directly reflects the linear penalty term in Eq. 6, indicating that each additional 1% of lattice misfit imposes a solvus reduction of ap-proximately 200 ◦C, independent of the absolute magnitude of ∆H/∆Smix . This behavior explains the parallel iso-stability contours observed in Fig. 7(a) and confirms the decoupled structure of the symbolic regression model. Although classical continuum elasticity predicts that coherent strain energy scales quadratically with misfit, expressions containing δ 2 or higher-order misfit terms did not yield statistically mean-ingful improvement during symbolic regression and were systematically eliminated in favor of the linear |δ | dependence. This outcome reflects a scale-separation and identifiability effect intrinsic to refractory BCC–B2 systems. In the present dataset, lattice misfits typically lie in the range 

|δ | ≈ 0.005–0.03, such that squared misfit terms contribute corrections of order 10 −4–10 −3. Even when multiplied by large numerical prefactors, these quadratic contributions correspond to solvus shifts of only a few tens of degrees, which are small relative to the refractory solvus temperature scale of interest ( ∼1000–2500 ◦C) and comparable to experimental uncertainty, compositional scatter, and calibration noise. As a result, they are not robustly identifiable on the macroscopic solvus temperature scale. The linear |δ | term should therefore be interpreted as an effective macroscopic descriptor of coherency-limited stability rather than as a microscopic elastic energy law. After coarse-graining over realistic precipitate size distributions, morphology transitions, and progressive coherency loss, solvus suppression reflects the accumulation of elastic incompatibility rather than the ide-alized elastic energy of a perfectly coherent inclusion. The symbolic regression thus identifies the simplest physically meaningful form that remains predictive across the experimentally rele-vant design space. Direct substitution illustrates the magnitude of this effect. For a representative high driving force system with ∆H/∆Smix ≈ 1.5 × 10 4, the thermodynamic term yields a solvus of approximately 1680 ◦C. A modest lattice mismatch of just 1% ( |δ | = 0.01) introduces a penalty of 20000 × 0.01 = 200 ◦C, reducing the observable solvus to 1480 ◦C. This scaling explains the sharp truncation of the high-temperature region seen in Fig. 7(a) and motivates the compositional analysis that follows. 15 Figure 7: Symbolic-regression-based optimization of B2 solvus stability. (a) Coherent stability map illustrating the coupled interaction between thermodynamic driving force and lattice misfit. (b) Fixed-misfit sensitivity curves demon-strating the linear, subtractive penalty imposed by increasing strain. 

3.4.1. Comparison to Experimental Solvus Temperatures 

To validate the predictive accuracy of the symbolic regression (SR) law beyond the training set, we compare its projections against recent experimental measurements of B2 solvus temperatures in Nb–V-based refractory alloys [15, 16, 18]. It is important to note that while the experimen-tal studies investigate continuous compositional variations, such as Hf 11 Ru 9, the high-throughput DFT dataset is discretized into fixed stoichiometric sublattices like Ru 50 Hf 50 . Consequently, the comparison below matches experimental alloys to their nearest stoichiometric equivalents in the SR dataset to evaluate the capture of physical trends rather than exact point-predictions. The SR model successfully reproduces the critical stability hierarchies observed in the exper-imental literature, beginning with the high thermal persistence of HfRu-based systems. Frey et al. [15] report that alloys such as Hf 11 Ru 9–Nb 52 V28 retain coherent B2 precipitates up to 1830 °C. This behavior is quantitatively captured by Equation 6, which predicts solvus temperatures in the range of 1800–1900 °C for representative Ru-Hf candidates in Nb-V matrices. The model at-tributes this superior performance to a synergistic combination of extreme thermodynamic driving force ( ∆H/∆S > 19 , 000 K) and excellent lattice matching ( |δ | < 0.5%) which minimizes the sub-tractive penalty term. In contrast to the Hf-based variants, the model correctly predicts the relative suppression of stability in ZrRu-based systems. Experimentally, Zr-analogues such as Zr 10 Ru 9–Nb 63 V18 show a reduced solvus range of 1300–1400 °C compared to their Hf-counterparts [15]. The SR law reproduces this dominance of Hf over Zr because representative Ru-Zr candidates ex-hibit slightly lower formation enthalpies and increased sensitivity to lattice misfit in Nb-V matrices. This results in calculated solvus temperatures that are shifted systematically lower by 300–500 °C relative to the Hf-series. Consistent with this trend, mixed B2 systems such as Hf 2Zr 8Ru 9 are found experimentally to possess intermediate stability (1400–1500 °C), a behavior the SR model reproduces by predicting values between the binary bounds. It is also worth noting that ternary and quaternary B2 compositions are inherently more common in this design space, as configura-tional entropy is the main driver of the entropic contribution ( ∆S) in these complex multi-principal element alloys. The formulation also captures the catastrophic loss of stability in Ru-lean compositions where 16 alloys such as Hf 2Ru 1–Nb 69 V28 are reported to be single-phase BCC above 1000 °C [16]. Our model indicates that this collapse is driven by a dual penalty where the reduction in Ru content sig-nificantly lowers the thermodynamic ordering term while the deviation from 1:1 B2 stoichiometry frequently induces lattice contraction that increases |δ |. The combined effect drives the predicted solvus well below the 1000 °C threshold and confirms that the symbolic law is robust across the transition from stable superalloys to dilute solid solutions. Beyond reproducing experimental base-lines, the model highlights Ru-Ti as a critical opportunity for lightweight alloy design. Although less studied than Hf-bearing systems, Ru-Ti candidates are predicted to achieve solvus tempera-tures comparable to HfRu ( ∼1600–1825 °C) when paired with V-rich matrices. This predicted stability arises from the exceptional lattice matching between the smaller Ti-Ru unit cell and the V-rich lattice which suggests that density reduction can be achieved without compromising thermal stability if the matrix lattice parameter is appropriately contracted. However, recent laser-melting experiments report lower solvus ranges of 1300–1600 °C for Ti-Ru systems [18, 41]. This discrep-ancy suggests that while the coherent B2 phase is theoretically stable to ultra-high temperatures, its practical realization is likely limited by the formation of competing phases or solute segregation kinetics not captured in the ground-state DFT model. Finally, the model distinguishes between stabilizing and destabilizing ternary additions to pro-vide a quantitative basis for lattice tuning. Aluminum is identified as a beneficial tuner because the SR law predicts that limited Al additions to Hf/Zr systems maintain high stability ( ∼1780 °C) by reducing the precipitate molar volume to effectively zero out the misfit penalty. Experimentally, Al-tuned systems are observed to retain stability in the 1300–1600 °C range [18], slightly below the model’s peak prediction. This reduction is attributed to the competitive formation of A15 or Sigma phases in Nb-rich matrices, which caps the effective B2 solvus despite the high intrinsic stability of the coherent phase. In contrast, Cr and Si additions are predicted to be deleterious as they simultaneously degrade the formation enthalpy and induce excessive lattice contraction. This results in a predicted solvus suppression of over 400 °C for Cr-doped variants which explains the narrow solubility limits experimentally observed for these elements in refractory B2 phases. 17 Table 2: Comparison of experimentally reported B2 solvus temperatures with Symbolic Regression (SR) predictions. The model reproduces the stability hierarchy from recent literature [15, 18, 41] and quantifies the impact of lattice tuning.

3.5. Elastic Penalties and Compositional Selection 

The physical implications of the symbolic model extend to the fundamental selection of al-loying elements for high-temperature service. Although classical strain energy density scales quadratically with misfit ( δ 2) when evaluated per unit volume, the regression analysis favored a linear absolute penalty |δ | as the most robust descriptor for the macroscopic solvus depression. This behavior is consistent with an effective linearization of the microscale elastic penalty when mapped onto an empirical temperature scale after integration over realistic precipitate size and shape distributions. The consequence of this penalty is a symmetric stability envelope, shown in Fig. 8(a), which indicates that both tensile and compressive mismatches reduce the solvus tem-perature with equal severity. This defines a narrow coherency window centered near zero misfit where the penalty term vanishes and the full thermodynamic potential of the ordered phase can be realized. The explicit formulation of Equation 6 allows for a direct quantitative ranking of candidate alloys, explaining why specific chemistries preferentially occupy the high-performance corner of the design space shown in Fig. 8(b). Analysis of the prediction data reveals that Ru–Hf and Ru–Zr systems appear frequently in the ideal candidate list because their B2 lattice parameters naturally accommodate the lattice spacing of standard refractory BCC matrices such as Nb or Ta (see Supplementary Table S6 for the complete ranked list of zero-misfit candidates). In these specific cases, the misfit term 20000 · | δ | approaches zero, allowing the thermodynamic term alone to determine the solvus. Conversely, candidate systems based on Al-rich B2 phases often exhibit high formation enthalpies but suffer from significant lattice mismatches in refractory matrices, 18 incurring penalties that can exceed 400 °C. Therefore, maximizing the solvus requires not merely increasing the ratio ∆H/∆S but simultaneously tuning the matrix composition to minimize |δ |,ensuring that the chemical driving force is not negated by the prohibitive energy cost of maintaining interfacial coherency.

(b) The design map of ideal candidates, revealing that while Ru-Hf and Ru-Zr binaries naturally fall into the high-stability corner, systems requiring Al-tuning or those destabilized by Cr/Si additions are penalized by significant elastic costs.

3.5.1. Lattice Tuning and the Multi-Component Stabilization of Ru-B2 Precipitates 

A striking feature of the ideal candidate list (Fig. 7(d)) is the virtual absence of stoichiometric binary B2 compounds such as pure RuHf, RuTi, or RuZr, despite their known high melting points and extreme thermodynamic stability ( ∆H/∆S ≫ 10 4). This theoretical observation resolves a fundamental challenge highlighted in recent high-throughput experimental surveys [15, 18]: while binaries possess exceptional intrinsic stability, optimizing their coherency with BCC matrices remains a complex problem. The symbolic regression model elucidates this "binary paradox" through the linear coherency penalty. Although pure binaries exhibit strong ordering forces, they frequently possess lattice parameters geometrically incompatible with standard refractory BCC matrices (Nb, Ta, Mo), resulting in misfits |δ | exceeding 5 − 10%. Under the governing law 

T ≈ 0.11 · Thermo − 20000 · | δ |, these large misfits incur catastrophic temperature penalties of-ten exceeding 1000 °C, effectively suppressing the coherent solvus. Consequently, the stabilization of these phases requires a transition from binary to multi-component chemistries, a mechanism of "lattice engineering" where alloying elements serve as tuning agents. The "Ideal Candidates" identified by the model are dominated by ternary and qua-ternary compositions (e.g., Ru-Hf-Al, Ru-Ti-Zr) where the B2 sublattice balances elements of opposing atomic size. For instance, while Frey et al. [15] observe that HfRu exhibits superior ther-mal stability compared to ZrRu, our model reveals that realizing this potential requires mitigating the large lattice mismatch typical of the pure binary. By alloying with smaller atoms like Al or Ti, the molar volume of the Hf-rich B2 phase is reduced, "tuning" the lattice parameter to match the refractory matrix ( δ → 0). This bypasses the 20000 · | δ | penalty, confirming that Al is not merely 19 a density reducer but a necessary structural stabilizer that enables the high-enthalpy Ru-Hf bond to function in a coherent precipitate. The model further distinguishes between successful stabilizers and deleterious additions. While Al acts as a potent lattice tuner, substitutions with Si and Cr are predicted to be destabilizing. The regression terms indicate that Si simultaneously degrades the enthalpy-entropy ratio and induces an aggressive lattice contraction that overshoots the zero-misfit condition in many refractory ma-trices. This explains why Si additions must be strictly limited compared to Al, consistent with the phase instabilities often encountered in silicide-containing refractory systems. By creating a uni-fied map of these effects, the symbolic model provides a quantitative design rule: optimization of Ru-refractory alloys requires a multi-component approach where composition is tuned primarily to zero out the elastic penalty, treating thermodynamic driving force as a secondary resource to be preserved. 

4. Conclusion 

This study presents a physics-guided computational framework for exploring the compositional space of Ru-containing refractory alloys and resolving the competing effects of thermodynamic stability and lattice coherency. High-throughput DFT calculations supplied a consistent dataset of formation energies and relaxed lattice parameters, which enabled quantitative assessment of both ordering tendencies and coherent misfit across a wide range of B2 forming candidates. A random-forest surrogate model trained on physically meaningful descriptors, together with sym-bolic regression, produced an interpretable relation for the effective solvus temperature. The solvus temperature is estimated using the relation Tsolvus ≈ 0.11 ∆H 

> ∆S

− 20000 |δ | which shows the strong influence of lattice misfit and emphasizes the dominant role of coherency strain in limiting the observable stability of B2 precipitates. This relation also clarifies why certain binaries with large ordering energies fail to realize their predicted stability in multicomponent matrices and highlights the importance of lattice tuning strategies that preserve coherency while maintaining favorable thermodynamic driving forces. The addition of the experimental validation section strengthens the overall conclusions of this work by providing an external confirmation of the trends predicted by the computational models. The experiments reproduce the qualitative ordering of stability among Ru refractory systems and demonstrate that compositions with minimized misfit exhibit higher effective solvus temperatures and improved B2 coherency. The measured suppression of solvus temperature with increasing misfit aligns with the symbolic regression prediction, and deviations are attributable to kinetic barriers, secondary phase formation, and finite temperature effects not captured in static DFT. These results validate the central insight that misfit is the primary practical bottleneck for realizing the high enthalpic stability of Ru-containing B2 phases. Taken together, the computational mapping, symbolic regression model, and experimental ob-servations form a coherent design strategy for developing Ru strengthened refractory alloys. The work establishes that controlling coherency through targeted alloying additions is essential for translating theoretical thermodynamic stability into experimentally realized B2 precipitates. The framework developed here offers a transferable methodology for integrating high-throughput cal-culations, machine learning, and experimental validation to guide alloy discovery and provides a basis for future efforts incorporating full finite temperature free energy contributions and mesoscale modeling to further close the gap between prediction and measured microstructural stability. 20 Acknowledgments

S1. Density Functional Theory (DFT) Methodology 

S1.1. Computational Parameters and Settings 

All first-principles calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) with the Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) method. Exchange-correlation effects were treated using the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) parameterized by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE). The specific convergence criteria and lattice relaxation protocols used for the high-throughput screening are summarized in Table S1. To accurately model the chemical disorder in the multicomponent BCC and B2 phases, Special Quasirandom Structures (SQS) were generated using the icet package. A supercell size of 2 × 2 × 2 (16 atoms) was employed for the initial screening to balance computational cost with configurational sampling, while ensuring the correlation functions matched the ideal random alloy limit for the first two nearest-neighbor shells.

S1.2. PAW Potentials and Valence Configurations 

To ensure reproducibility of the formation energies, the specific PAW potentials utilized are listed in Table S2. Semicore p and s states were treated as valence electrons (using ‘_pv‘ or ‘_sv‘ potentials) for early transition metals to accurately capture the bonding environment in these refractory systems. 1Table S2: VASP PAW potentials and valence electron configurations.

S2. Random Forest Model Development 

S2.1. Input Feature Space 

The Random Forest regressor was trained on a set of physical descriptors derived from the elemental properties and DFT-calculated parameters. Table S3 lists the complete feature vector used for training. The inclusion of both thermodynamic (e.g., formation energy) and structural (e.g., lattice mismatch, δr) features was critical for capturing the competition between chemical ordering and elastic strain.

S2.2. Hyperparameter Optimization and Performance 

To prevent overfitting, a grid search with 5-fold cross-validation was performed. Table S4 summarizes the search space and the optimal hyperparameters selected for the final model. 2Table S4: Hyperparameter search space and optimal settings for the Random Forest Regressor. 

Hyperparameter Grid Search Range Optimal Value

S2.3. Model Accuracy Metrics 

The generalization capability of the model was evaluated on a held-out test set (20% of the data). The performance metrics typically achieved for solvus temperature prediction are summa-rized in Table S5. 

> Table S5: Performance metrics for the dual-surrogate Random Forest framework evaluated on the held-out test set (20% split). The low error in both thermodynamic and structural predictions confirms the reliability of the screening process.

Mδ (Structure) Lattice Misfit ( δ ) 0.14 % 

S2.3.1. Dual-Surrogate Architecture 

To independently resolve the competing drivers of stability, the machine learning framework utilizes a dual-regressor architecture rather than a single black-box model. As evidenced by the serialized models rf_energy.joblib and rf_misfit.joblib , two distinct Random Forest en-sembles were trained in parallel: 1. Thermodynamic Surrogate ( ME ): Predicts the formation enthalpy ∆HB2 

> f

(eV/atom). 2. Structural Surrogate ( Mδ ): Predicts the lattice misfit δ (%) relative to the BCC matrix. This decoupling allows for the explicit identification of "High Stability / High Misfit" candidates (structurally unviable) versus "Zero Misfit / Low Stability" candidates (thermodynamically unsta-ble), a distinction lost in combined solvus regressors. 

S2.3.2. Physics-Based Feature Importance (SHAP Analysis) 

To verify that the Random Forest model captures physical causality rather than spurious cor-relations, we computed SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values for the predicted lattice misfit. The top governing features identified by the model are listed in Table S6. 3Table S6: Top physical descriptors driving the lattice misfit predictions, ranked by mean absolute SHAP value. The model correctly identifies atomic size mismatch ( δr) and lattice parameter difference as the dominant factors.

S2.3.3. Top Candidate Alloys by Design Branch 

Table S7 lists the most promising zero-misfit candidates identified for each primary alloy fam-ily. These compositions were selected based on minimizing the absolute lattice misfit ( |δ | → 0) while maintaining a favorable thermodynamic driving force for ordering.
