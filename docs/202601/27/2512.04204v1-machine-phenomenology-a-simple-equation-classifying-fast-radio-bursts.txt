This work shows how human physical reasoning can guide machine-driven symbolic regression toward discovering empirical laws from observations. As an example, we derive a simple equation that classifies fast radio bursts (FRBs) into two distinct Gaussian distributions, indicating the existence of two physical classes. This human–AI workflow integrates feature selection, dimensional analysis, and symbolic regression: deep learning first analyzes CHIME Catalog 1 and identifies six independent parameters that collectively provide a complete description of FRBs; guided by Buckingham– π analysis and correlation analysis, humans then construct dimensionless groups; finally, symbolic regression performed by the machine discovers the governing equation. When applied to the newer CHIME Catalog, the equation produces consistent results, demonstrating that it captures the underlying physics. This framework is applicable to a broad range of scientific domains.

## 1 Introduction 

Phenomenology constructs approximated equations that pre-dict and explain empirical data without requiring exhaustive theoretical foundations, bridging experimental observations and theoretical laws [1,2]. Machine learning (ML) [3] is well-suited for phenomenological studies because it can identify patterns and correlations from data [4]. Symbolic regression [5], a branch of machine learning, searches for mathematical expressions that best fit the data [6-8]. For example, it rediscovered Kepler’s third law [9] and Newton’s laws [10]. It modeled the Kondo temperature

in condensed matter systems [11] and recovered the Lorenz system equations of dynamical systems [12]. For further ex-amples, we refer to review papers such as [5, 13, 14]. Despite these successes, symbolic regression still faces fundamental limitations. Most studies validate their meth-ods by rediscovering known laws with a few parameters rather than discovering new, especially complex, ones. This is partly because the search space grows combinatorially with the size of the operator set, the expression depth, and the number of parameters. The presence of noisy data fur-ther increases computational cost and produces many near-equivalent expressions. Therefore, the machine needs human experience and guid-ance. We establish a machine phenomenology framework in which human reasoning and machine learning are cou-pled to derive empirical equations from observational data. The workflow proceeds as follows. First, deep learning is used for feature selection, identifying a minimal set of in-dependent parameters that capture the essential variability of the system. Second, guided by dimensional analysis and the Buckingham– π theorem, humans construct dimensionless groups that encode physical invariances and scaling relations. Third, these dimensionless quantities are provided to the ma-chine, which performs symbolic regression to search for ana-lytical expressions that best describe the data. Finally, the re-sulting equations are cross-validated on independent datasets to test their robustness and generality. We apply this procedure to the classification of fast radio bursts (FRBs) [15-17]. FRBs are intense, millisecond-duration radio flares that predominantly originate at cosmological distances, making them one of the most compelling unsolved mysteries in con-temporary astrophysics [17-21]. Since their first detection in 2007 by the Parkes Telescope [22], thousands of FRBs have been identified, but their origins remain elusive. These enig-matic bursts are observationally divided into repeaters (multi-ple bursts) and non-repeaters (single observed bursts), though some non-repeaters may simply be under-observed. Whether these two types are intrinsically distinct in their physical ori-gins remains an active and debated question [23]. Before testing the physical models that explain the characteristics of these two potential FRB types, it is essential first to confirm the existence of this dichotomy. We aim to find an equation from the observables, which is accurate and interpretable, to verify the possible FRB classes. This article is structured as follows. The selection and analysis of FRB parameters are discussed in Section 2. Two di ff erent symbolic regression approaches to deriving classi-fication equations, along with their results, are presented in Section 3. Section 4 reports our results and the application of the discovered equations to new data. The final discussion and conclusions can be found in Section 5. 

## 2 Parameter Selection and Analysis 

2.1 CHIME Catalogs 

We adopted data from the first CHIME /FRB catalog [24], which included 536 FRBs observed between July 25, 2018 and July 1, 2019. This dataset contains 474 bursts from non-repeating sources and 62 bursts from 18 repeating sources. Hereafter, we refer to the first CHIME /FRB catalog as Cata-log 1. We treated each sub-burst as an independent event, result-ing in a total of 600 sub-bursts [25]. To ensure data consis-tency, we excluded six non-repeating bursts 1) that lack flux. This pre-processing step produced a final dataset of 594 in-dependent sub-bursts, with 500 from apparent non-repeaters and 94 from repeaters. We note that due to instrumental bandwidth limitations, the values of certain parameters are constrained, and the cor-responding entries in the catalog may not be entirely accu-rate. Nevertheless, we retain these data points during model training. This decision is motivated by, first, given the limited sample size, excluding these data would result in the removal of approximately half of the non-repeating sources. Second, such points can be interpreted as statistical upper or lower limits, which o ff er informative constraints that the model may still exploit. The second catalog [26], identified between September 30, 2019 and May 1, 2021, consists of 98 high confidence bursts, totaling 119 sub-bursts from 25 repeating sources. Six of these had previously been classified as non-repeaters in Cat-alog 1 [24]. We will use this new catalog to evaluate our derived equations. The second catalog also includes 14 un-certain candidates, which are not included in our analysis. Hereafter, we call the second catalog as Catalog 2. This cat-alog is an updated repeater catalog, and the complete second catalog is still underway. When required by symbolic regression, for example, in the parameter selection procedure, we normalize the data set using Z-score normalization[27]. This is achieved by trans-forming the data using the formula 

X′

= X − μσ (1) where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation of the data X. Normalization of the Z-score ensures that the trans-formed data retain the shape of the original distribution while

aligning its mean and standard deviation to 0 and 1, respec-tively. This normalization helps improve numerical stabil-ity and accelerates convergence by preventing features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning loss. Concerning the imbalance of data samples between non-repeaters and repeaters, with the repeaters being roughly five times less frequent. It is essential to prevent our models from inadvertently learning this imbalance. To address this issue, we utilized the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) [28], as implemented in the imbalanced-learn 

package [29], to artificially expand the repeater sample, matching its size to the non-repeater sample in the training set. As a result, after augmentation, the training set includes an equal number of repeaters and non-repeaters. The formulas derived from symbolic regression are orders of magnitude simpler compared to normal neural networks, and we tend to prefer simpler formulas. Therefore, overfitting in symbolic regression is much less severe than the normal neural networks. In fact, these formulas might even overlook some details. Hence, when performing symbolic regression, it is not necessary to strictly separate the training and testing datasets. In our case, we use all data from Catalog 1 to derive the formulae, which are subsequently applied to both Catalog 1 and 2. 

2.2 Six Key Parameters 

The Catalog 1 lists 48 observational parameters 2) . To iden-tify the most critical parameters, we first perform parame-ter selection (feature selection). Specifically, we train 100 fully connected neural networks, each with four hidden layers and a total of 33,280 parameters, using all 48 observational parameters to classify non-repeaters and repeaters. To as-sess the importance of each observational parameter, we use SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) values [30], which quantify how much each feature contributes to the classifica-tion results. For each network, we rank the six most impor-tant parameters based on their SHAP values. Figure 1 shows the total count of each parameter, representing how often it appears among the top six across all networks. Finally, we select the most frequently occurring six parameters. Notably, we include ∆t but not ∆t (Boxcar). This choice is based on our analysis method, which examines each sub-burst indi-vidually. The ∆t parameter measures the duration of each single sub-burst, making it suitable for our method, while 

∆t (Boxcar) represents the total duration of an entire burst that may contain multiple sub-bursts. The boxcar width typ-ically includes additional intra-channel dispersion smearing and scattering, which do not robustly represent the intrinsic pulse width [24, 31]. t

> Figure 1 Visualization of the feature selection. The plot shows the fre-quency with which each feature was ranked among the top six most impor-tant features across 100 neural network models. The green rectangles high-light the six selected features. Parameters include: α: spectral index; ∆t:sub-burst width; DM : excess DM using YMW16 model; ∆t(Boxcar): entire burst width from boxcar method; f: flux density; ∆ν: frequency bandwidth;
> νp: peak frequency; DM (NE2001): excess DM using NE2001 model; χ2:chi-square statistic; νlow : lower frequency bound; νhigh : upper frequency bound.

These six parameters selected by the neural network ex-actly provide a comprehensive description of FRB observa-tions, with each parameter playing a unique role that cannot be substituted by another. From an observational perspec-tive, ∆ν (freq width = high freq - low freq )3) repre-sents the energy range of the spectrum. νp (peak freq ) and 

α (sp idx ) specify the peak frequency and the spectral in-dex 4) , respectively, together they define the spectral shape. f

(flux ) measures the flux density, representing the intensity of the radiation, and ∆t (width fitb ) describes the duration of the emission. Mathematically, these parameters define a spectrum over a specific energy range and duration. Ad-ditionally, DM (dm exc ymw16 ) estimates the source’s dis-tance, enabling the conversion of observed quantities into the cosmological rest frame for inferring the physical properties of the FRB. The distributions of the six parameters are shown in Figure 2. We test the neural network using these six parameters, it yields an accuracy of ∼ 95%. This accuracy sets a benchmark for our symbolic regression approach. In theory, a su ffi ciently complex function could achieve comparable accuracy. How-ever, in practice, we prioritize simplicity alongside accuracy, which means the final equation may fall slightly short of this

benchmark. This trade-o ff is deliberate, as our equations are designed to normally include fewer than 10 symbolic opera-tions by these selected parameters, in contrast to the neural network’s 33280 parameters (weights of neural network) per-forming numerous nonlinear computations. 

2.3 Physical Implication From Selection 

First, these six parameters collectively represent a complete set that captures the diverse observational characteristics of FRBs. Their ability to describe spectral shape, burst dura-tion, brightness, and distance-related features indicates that the di ff erences between repeating and non-repeating bursts are not confined to a single aspect but extend across the full range of observable properties. This finding supports the hypothesis that the two classes may arise from distinct pro-cesses. Second, these six parameters are selected by the machine from a larger set of 48 observational parameters. Their coher-ent emergence statistically suggests that the di ff erences be-tween repeaters and non-repeaters are intrinsic rather than a result of observational bias. 

2.4 Parameters Pairwise Relations 

We compute the pairwise relationships among six parame-ters and fitted the data points of repeaters and non-repeaters separately using a power-law model, obtaining the power-law index. We also calculate the correlation coe ffi cient for each relation 5) . The results are shown in Figure 3. Our analy-sis included all 94 repeaters and 500 non-repeaters. Further-more, to account for data randomness and to better compare with the statistics of repeaters, we randomly sampled 94 non-repeaters. The strongest correlation for repeaters is νp vs ∆ν (0.78), with a steep positive slope (2.01), plotted in Figure 4. For non-repeaters (both full and random subsets), this correlation is weaker (0.25–0.33) with flatter slopes (0.53–0.69). The strong positive correlation suggests that bursts with higher peak frequencies tend to have wider frequency ranges. This could indicate that the emission mechanism produces broader spectra at higher frequencies, possibly due to the energy dis-tribution of emitting particles or /and the size of the emission region. In addition, many repeaters exhibit down-drifting [33, 34], where later emissions occur at progressively lower frequencies. This suggests a systematic relation between νp

and ∆ν, strengthening this correlation. The anti-correlation between f and DM is stronger in re-peaters ( −0.49) than in non-repeaters ( −0.29), supporting the idea that flux diminishes with distance (proportional to DM 

) due to the inverse-square law. The weaker trend in non-repeaters may reflect a combination of progenitor distance variations and the broad intrinsic luminosity distribution. Non-repeaters exhibit a moderate anti-correlation ( −0.45) between α and ∆ν, indicating that broader bandwidths are as-sociated with flatter spectra. In contrast, repeaters show no significant trend ( −0.190). Both populations exhibit negative Pearson correlations be-tween ∆t and f (repeaters: −0.27; non-repeaters: −0.36), im-plying that brighter bursts tend to release energy over shorter timescales. The weaker correlation in repeaters may suggest that their energy release is more stochastic. However, we must also note that the above discussions may be related to the sample size. Although there are a to-tal of 94 bursts from repeaters, they originate from only 18 sources. Statistically, this may lead to conclusions suggest-ing similar origins. Further observations are needed to assess the significance of the observational e ff ect. 4 × 10 2 5 × 10 2 6 × 10 2 7 × 10 2 8 × 10 2

A non-parametric Gaussian Process fit (grey line) with its 1-σuncertainty region is also shown, capturing potential nonlinear trends in the relationship. The data points hit the boundaries, marked by dots with white centers, are due to the limited bandwidth of the CHIME telescope.

2.5 Parameters Importance and nonlinearity 

Understanding the nonlinearity of input features (six parame-ters) and their interactions is helpful for guiding equation dis-covery in symbolic regression. To address this, we develop a perturbation framework that quantifies feature importance and pairwise interactions by analyzing output deviations un-der input variations.

The sensitivity of a model g to an individual feature xi is determined by first computing the baseline output 

g0 = g(x1, x2, . . . , xi, . . . , xm). (2) Each feature xi is then perturbed by an increment δxi = σxi ,where σxi represents the standard deviation of xi across the dataset. The perturbed output 

gxi = g(x1, x2, . . . , xi + δxi, . . . , xm) (3) is then used to calculate the feature’s influence through the first-order deviation 

∆gxi = gxi − g0. (4) Features exhibiting larger absolute |∆gxi | values influence the model’s prediction the most, as their perturbation induces the largest output shifts. To disentangle pairwise interactions between features xi

and x j, both parameters are perturbed simultaneously ( xi +

σxi , x j + σx j ), resulting in the joint perturbed output 

gxi,x j = g(x1, x2, . . . , xi + δxi, . . . , x j + δx j, . . . , xm). (5) The combined e ff ect is quantified as 

∆gxi,x j = gxi,x j − g0, (6) representing the importance of changing a pair of parameters simultaneously. To identify nonlinear interactions between pairs of param-eters, we introduce 

ηxi,x j = ∆ gxi,x j − ∆gxi − ∆gx j (7) to isolate interaction e ff ects that deviate from additive contri-butions. A non-zero ηxi,x j signals the presence of nonlinear dependencies. This methodology aids in hypothesizing the structure of potential equations for symbolic regression. By analyzing 

∆gxi and ∆gx j along with ηxi,x j , we can infer possible relation-ships. Some examples are: 1) When opposing signs in ∆gxi

and ∆gx j coincide with ηxi,x j ≈ 0, the interaction is consistent with linear subtraction. 2) A positive ηxi,x j , e.g., ∆gxi = + 0.3, 

∆gx j = + 0.2, ηxi,x j = + 0.3, indicates amplification beyond additive e ff ects. This aligns with multiplicative terms like 

xi · x j, where perturbing both features introduces cross-terms. 3) Non-zero but small ηxi,x j suggests higher-order interac-tions, e.g. g ∝ (xi + x j)2 introduces a cross-term 2 xi x j, which amplifies η when both features are perturbed. Figure 5 shows the interaction matrices of the six parame-ters, which will be implemented in the next section. 

## 3 Methods 

Two approaches are employed in our phenomenological for-mula search process. The first approach is to fit an equation that is a product of multiple power laws, which is a common form in astrophysics. The second approach involves non-dimensionalization by human first, followed by the machine identifying a classification equation. 

3.1 Criteria: Precision, Recall and F2 Score 

In FRB classification, sources are divided into repeaters and non-repeaters. However, due to limited observational cover-age and inherent uncertainties, some sources currently clas-sified as non-repeaters may eventually be recognized as re-peaters. Moreover, repeaters are substantially fewer in num-ber compared with non-repeaters for current samples [24,26]. Y. Liu, et al. Sci. China-Phys. Mech. Astron. () Vol. No. -7 

To address these issues, we adopt the F2 score as our eval-uation metric [35]. The F2 score is defined as a weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall. Precision is given by 

P = TP TP + FP , (8) where TP denotes the true repeaters correctly identified and FP denotes the non-repeaters misclassified as repeaters. Re-call is defined as 

R = TP TP + FN , (9) with FN representing repeaters that are missed. The general-ized F-score is formulated as 

Fβ = (1 + β2) · P × R

β2 · P + R . (10) Setting β = 2 weights recall more heavily than precision, which is important when missing a true repeater is consid-ered a more serious error than including some non-repeaters. In the meanwhile, it minimizes the false alarm that the non-repeaters incorrectly labeled as repeaters. Our equation searching process prioritizes optimizing re-call first, followed by the F2 score. Given the class imbalance in the dataset (500 vs 94) and considering each class should be equally important, we first compute the statistical eval-uation metrics respectively for each class and then take the average. 

3.2 Power-Law Multiplication 

In astrophysics, equations frequently take the form of power-laws, which can be understood from both theoretical and ob-servational perspectives. From the theoretical aspect, power-laws naturally emerge in systems that exhibit scale-invariant behavior, as the same physics operates across di ff erent scales spanning orders of magnitude in size, time and energy. Ob-servations in astrophysics often span limited ranges of data, and power-laws are simple models that fit well to log-log plots, where a straight line indicates a power-law relation-ship. Coherent emission processes, thought to be the FRB emis-sion mechanism, often produce power-law spectra. Disper-sion and scattering in the interstellar medium, which a ff ect FRBs, often follow power-laws due to the frequency depen-dence of plasma interactions. Such physical mechanisms are common in FRB studies, and the observations, such as the en-ergy distribution, fluence, and event rates are often analyzed using power-law fits. Therefore, the frequent appearance of power-laws in as-trophysical equations, especially in FRBs, reflects both the fundamental nature of many astrophysical processes and the practical utility of these models in interpreting observational data. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the threshold di ff erentiating repeaters and non-repeaters can be approxi-mately described by the multiplication of power-laws,

, (11) We first applied transformations to the 6 selected param-eters. For parameters expected to follow power-law scal-ing ( f, DM , ∆ν, ∆t, ν p), we used a logarithmic transformation, 

xi = log 10 (Xi). However, the spectral index α is already an exponent and can take negative values, we included α di-rectly. This converts the multiplicative relationships into the additive form which enabled us to apply the linear regression models 

θ = β0 + β1 x1 + β2 x2 + · · · + β6 x6 (12) where θ = log 10 (ΘPL ) is the dependent variable (e.g., poten-tial physical quantity to determine if the FRB belongs to a re-peat burst), x1, x2, . . . , x6 are the selected key parameters, β0

is a constant, β1, β 2, . . . , β 6 are the regression coe ffi cients that capture the influence of each parameter. This approach helps to construct a simplified model that captures FRB phenom-ena and identifies patterns that are not immediately apparent in the raw data. 

3.3 Neural Dimensionless Regression (NDR) 

Normally the first step of neural network training is normal-ization, features are normalized because datasets with large variations may lead to numerical instability and network di-vergence. However, normalization cancels out the units of physical quantities, causing the network to lose information about their dimensional relationships. Consequently, when deriving equations, the machine may produce physically in-correct formulas. Currently, symbolic regression methods address dimen-sional consistency by incorporating additional constraints during training. For instance, PySR does not inherently en-force unit consistency, so users must manually define con-straints, such as restricting operations to guide the regres-sion process or filtering out results that do not match ex-pected units after training [7]. In contrast, PhySO requires users to specify the units of each input and output variable, it enforces unit consistency by allowing only equations where all terms have matching units [36]. Ensuring dimensionally correct equations in these methods comes at a high compu-tational cost, particularly for complex systems. And the en-forcement of dimensional consistency may exclude potential candidate equations, especially when minor deviations arise due to limitations in data precision, restricting their applica-bility to noisy data which is common in astronomy.

We propose a human-machine collaborative approach, where humans perform physics-informed preprocessing to produce dimensionless features and reduce the number of features using dimensional constraints. Consequently, the machine no longer needs to account for dimensional con-sistency but already takes advantage of dimensional analysis from the human’s preprocessing, thereby reducing compu-tational time and mitigating the risk of missing the correct equation due to the enforcement of dimensional consistency in the presence of noisy data. We refer to this method as the 

Neural Dimensionless Regression (NDR). The mathematical foundation of NDR is the Buckingham 

π theorem [37], which states that any physical equation in-volving n variables and k fundamental physical dimensions can be rewritten in terms of ( n − k) independent dimension-less groups called π groups. The first step in applying the π theorem is to list the rele-vant variables and their corresponding physical dimensions. We consider six measured parameters along with one physi-cal constant: Planck’s constant ( h). The fundamental dimen-sions involved are mass [ M], length [ L], and time [ T ], giving a total of six dimensional variables and one dimensionless variable ( α). The physical dimensions of these features are summarized as follows 1. Spectral width ( ∆ν): [ T −1]2. Peak frequency ( νp): [ T −1]3. Flux density ( f ): [ ML −2]4. Duration ( ∆t): [ T ]5. Dispersion measure (DM): [ L−2]6. Spectral index ( α): Dimensionless 7. Planck’s constant ( h): [ ML 2T −1]Since there are three fundamental dimensions [ M, L, T ], the number of independent dimensionless groups is deter-mined by the Buckingham π theorem as n − k = 6 − 3 = 3, meaning three independent dimensionless groups, plus the al-ready dimensionless α.To construct these groups, it is necessary to select three repeating variables that must satisfy two conditions 

• They must span all fundamental dimensions [ M, L, T ]; 

• They must be physically independent, meaning that no variable can be derived from the others. However, in practice, there is more than one set of variables that meet these two conditions, which is one of the challenges of dimensional analysis. In section 2.5, we have introduced the perturbation method, which can assist in selecting the op-timal set of repeating variables in at least two aspects 

• Importance: variables with high influence (high ∆g) are likely to have a larger impact on the system and may be better candidates as repeating variables; 

• Simplicity: variables with low linearity (low η) indicate less synergistic or antagonistic interaction, ensuring variables Y. Liu, et al. Sci. China-Phys. Mech. Astron. () Vol. No. -9 

contribute distinct physical e ff ects to the system and simpli-fying the dimensionless groups to produce scaling laws that are more intuitive and generalizable. Among the six original parameters, only the flux ( f ) con-tains the mass dimension [ M]. To make it dimensionless, we have introduced a seventh parameter, the Planck constant h,which also carries the [ M] dimension. Since we are studying electromagnetic radiation, the introduction of the Planck con-stant is also physically meaningful. Both h and f encompass the three fundamental dimensions [ M, L, T ] and are mathe-matically eligible to be selected together in a dimensionless group. However, perturbation method results (Figure 5, left) show that among the six parameters, f has the least influ-ence on the outcome. Therefore, to introduce the [ M] dimen-sion, we select either h or f , while choosing parameters with greater influence for the other dimensions. Since selecting 

h or f does not a ff ect the dimensionless group, as both will appear in the same group, we choose h here. Among the remaining five parameters, α is inherently di-mensionless, and DM is associated with the [ L] dimension, while the other three parameters correspond to the [ T ] di-mension. Since DM is the only parameter related to [ L], it is a necessary choice. Additionally, perturbation method results indicate that DM itself has a high level of importance. For selecting the parameter representing the [ T ] dimen-sion, we first evaluate the importance of the three parameters: 

∆∆t > ∆∆ν > ∆νp . Next, we analyze the degree of nonlinear interactions between these parameters and the others (Figure 5, right). Comparing the η values of these three variables with respect to DM and f , which represent the other two dimen-sions, we find η∆t = ηνp < η ∆ν. Consequently, we select ∆t as the representative parameter for the [ T ] dimension. Finally, the choice is {h, DM , ∆t}, these variables collec-tively provide independent units of mass (via h), length (via DM and h), and time (via ∆t and h). Each remaining vari-able is then expressed as a dimensionless product involving powers of these repeating variables. The first dimensionless parameter is obtained by combin-ing ∆ν and ∆t:

π1 = ∆ ν∆t, (13) this combination is the time-bandwidth product. A larger value might indicate more dispersed signals or certain emis-sion mechanisms. The second dimensionless parameter is constructed using 

νp and ∆t:

π2 = νp∆t, (14) this term quantifies temporal-spectral correlation, could be relate to the number of wave cycles in the burst. Constructing a dimensionless parameter involving flux f :

π3 = f ∆thDM , (15) this term compares observed flux to intrinsic energy density, scaled by plasma dispersion e ff ects. A higher values suggest more luminous bursts. The spectral index α is already dimensionless and remains as 

π4 = α, (16) which characterizes spectral shape. The application of the Buckingham π theorem thus reduces six dimensional parameters to four independent dimension-less terms (three derived groups plus α). The form of the equation we are looking for can be expressed as 

ΘNDR = F ∆ν∆t, ν p∆t , f ∆th DM , α 

!

, (17) where the threshold can be defined by our preference, for example, as being smaller than 0 for non-repeaters and larger than 0 for repeaters. This equation avoids degeneracy, aligns with astrophysical scaling laws, and preserves physical clar-ity. 

3.4 Probabilistic Model 

Since this is a classification problem, we expect the equa-tion ΘNDR to represent the distributions of the two classes. Thereby allowing us to compute the probability of an event being classified as either a repeater or a non-repeater by the classical Sigmoid function after normalizing to ¯ ΘNDR 

σ( ¯ ΘNDR ) = 11 + e− ¯ΘNDR 

. (18) The output range of σ( ¯ ΘNDR ) is (0 , 1), representing the prob-ability that the classification belongs to the positive class (re-peater), denoted as p. The probability of the negative class (non-repeater) is then 1 − p. In a typical binary classification problem, if p ≥ 0.5 (i.e., ¯ ΘNDR ≥ 0), the instance is predicted as the positive class (repeater). If p < 0.5 (i.e., ¯ ΘNDR < 0), it is predicted as the negative class (non-repeater). We employ PySR for symbolic regression and restrict the operator set to {+, −, ×, ÷, pow } for simplicity. Addition and subtraction represent the linear superposition of physical quantities, while multiplication and division capture relation-ships such as proportional scaling, aligning with the math-ematical structures of classical physical laws. The pow op-erator is introduced to accommodate the nonlinear relations, and the potential approximations involving f and DM . These two parameters may require integration, which our equation Y. Liu, et al. Sci. China-Phys. Mech. Astron. () Vol. No. -10 

does not explicitly incorporate, we approximate it using an exponential function. To derive the equation, we minimize the cross-entropy loss 

L( ˆ Θ, ¯ΘNDR ) = − ˆΘ log σ( ¯ ΘNDR )

− (1 − ˆΘ) log(1 − σ( ¯ ΘNDR )) . (19) where ˆ Θ is the ground-truth labels, taken as the catalog’s clas-sifications. In information theory, entropy quantifies the un-certainty in a system, and cross-entropy measures how much extra information is needed when using an estimated distri-bution instead of the true one. Therefore, minimizing cross-entropy loss decreases the discrepancy between the equa-tion’s predictions and the catalog’s classifications, guiding the model towards more accurate predictions with less infor-mational ine ffi ciency. Notably, we separated the equation of ΘNDR from the non-linear probability equation and the loss function, rather than directly optimizing ΘNDR to output classification probabili-ties. This procedure allows ΘNDR retains a simple, physically interpretable form while reducing operator complexity and constraining the search space of the genetic algorithm. All found candidate equations strictly follow the constraint of dimensional homogeneity since the input dimensionless groups have eliminated the influence of the original dimen-sions, and the operator combination process always maintains dimensional balance. Since we are dealing with a classifica-tion task, the equation output must be a dimensionless quan-tity, which is naturally ensured by the direct combination of these dimensionless groups. Considering the generalizability of the equation, we prior-itize simplicity in its derivation rather than solely maximizing classification accuracy on Catalog 1. This is because the data itself contains uncertainties, and there is no prior conclusion that the two classifications can be perfectly distinguished us-ing observational parameters. As a result, the accuracy of the equation is likely to have an upper limit. Over-optimizing for accuracy may lead to overfitting, where the equation captures specific features of certain bursts in Catalog 1 rather than the underlying general properties. Therefore, we set a recall and F2-score threshold of 80% for the initial filtering and, under the primary constraint of simplicity, aim for higher accuracy. Technically, under the PySR framework, the “best” scor-ing rule governs the evolutionary search by explicitly balanc-ing mathematical simplicity and predictive accuracy. This dual-objective optimization penalizes excessive complex-ity through operator-specific weights (e.g., imposing higher costs for exponentiation than addition), thereby enforcing Occam’s Razor to mitigate overfitting while retaining physi-cally meaningful structures. 

## 4 Results 

4.1 Power-Law Model: Results 

To fit and to evaluate the e ff ectiveness of the power-law multiplication method in distinguishing between repeating and non-repeating FRBs, we applied a linear regression model using the scikit-learn package [38] to Catalog 1 [24]. The regression analysis aimed to determine the coe ffi cients 

β0, β 1, . . . , β 6 as shown in Equation (12). To mitigate variability in the equation’s performance, we performed 100 randomized train-test splits of the dataset. The final coe ffi cients are selected based on the iteration achieving the highest F2 score across all Catalog 1 bursts. Meanwhile, we should note that the accuracy of these coe ffi cients is not guaranteed due to the impact of the training set, which in-cludes possible mislabeled data, simulated repeater samples, and data with varying distributions. Despite these constraints, the optimized equation achieves strong classification performance, with an F2-score of 0 .88 and a recall of 0 .91 at the classification threshold of 0 .5.

(20) The bursts with ΘPL ≤ 0.5 are classified as non-repeaters, while ΘPL > 0.5 are classified as repeaters. Figure 7 shows its classification results. 

4.2 Power-Law Model: Physical Interpretation 

From the absolute value of the exponent in the fitted equa-tion, we can determine the sensitivity of each parameter to classification, i.e., how a change of one order of magnitude aff ects the result. It can be observed that νp has the highest sensitivity, while f has the lowest. For the α term, we have 

e0.013 α = 10 0.0056 α, indicating that its sensitivity on the order of magnitude is 0 .0056 α, which increases as α grows. If we consider the impact degree of each parameter on the result, we must also account for the order of magnitude of the parameter’s value range, as shown in Figure 2. This gives the order-of-magnitude changes for each parameter’s entire range: α: 0.61, f : -0.48, DM : -0.71, ∆ν: -0.429, ∆t: 0.75 and 

νp: 0.23, which are largely consistent with the rankings from the parameter selection of neural networks shown in Figure 1. This equation not only captures the tendency of each pa-rameter toward classification but also reflects the relation-ships among parameters. For example, considering ∆ν and Y. Liu, et al. Sci.

νp, Figure 2 shows that repeaters tend to have higher νp and lower ∆ν. Correspondingly, the exponents in the equation are 0.75 and −0.44, which align with this tendency. Furthermore, this is consistent with the relationship ∆ν ≈ ν2 

> p

shown in Fig-ure 4, proved by substituting this relation into the equation, the ∆ν and νp terms nearly cancel each other out ( −0.88 vs. 0.75). From the equation, repeaters have steep spectral indices (α), higher peak frequencies ( νp), narrower bandwidths ( ∆ν), longer durations ( ∆t), and a strong correlation between peak frequency ( νp) and bandwidth ( ∆ν). Any proposed compet-itive FRB radiation mechanism should explain these di ff er-ences. The dispersion measure ( DM ) appears to indicate that re-peaters are more localized, a possible interpretation is that nearby ones have lower luminosities and the repetition rate is luminosity dependent. Usually it takes longer for high-luminosity bursts to repeat. The far-away non-repeaters could be simply repeaters that just take longer to repeat. We also need to be cautious about the limited sample size that each burst from a repeating source has di ff erent radiation features but the same DM , 94 bursts actually originate from only 18 sources, meaning there are e ff ectively only 18 independent 

DM values. Insu ffi cient data may cause inaccurate infer-ences. Flux ( f ) is the least sensitive parameter, repeaters and non-repeaters have similar energy magnitudes. This suggests they might share a common engine source, such as magnetic en-ergy from a compact star, while di ff ering in their energy re-lease mechanisms. This empirical equation relies on a linear combination of log-transformed parameters (via power-law scaling) to clas-sify bursts. While it reflects the sensitivity and impact of each parameter on distinguishing populations, this approach has inherent limitations in capturing nonlinear or complex rela-tionships, which we will address by the next approach. 

4.3 NDR: Results 

We have constructed the four dimensionless groups derived from Buckingham’s π theorem, transforming observed pa-rameters into dimensionless physical forms. Due to the stochastic nature of the genetic algorithm in PySR, the optimal equation obtained varies in each run. We performed 10,000 fittings, generating 10,000 candidate equa-tions, and then ranked them by F2-score and recall (many equations output identical classification scores). We observed that the equations with recall and F2-score over 0 .8 mostly do not include the π3 term, while some combinations of π1 and 

π2 frequently appear. Finally, we selected the a simple equa-tion with F2-score 0 .82 and recall 0 .87, as 

ΘNDR = (π2 − π1)0.3 + π2

0.3π1

+ π4 (21) or in the form of the observables 

ΘNDR = (νp − ∆ν)0.3∆t0.3 + νp

0.3∆ν + α (22) As expected, ΘNDR can be well fitted by the superposition of two Gaussian distributions, see Figure 9, which is the most important result of this article. The Gaussian distribution with a lower mean contains most of the non-repeaters (gray histogram bars), while the Gaussian distribution with a higher mean primarily includes the repeaters (black histogram bars). A small number of non-repeaters also fall within the Gaussian distribution with the higher mean, these non-repeaters might be repeaters for which the repeating phenomenon has not yet been observed. The limitations from observation are evident in the distribution. For instance, in Figure 9, a bin of excep-tional high count appears on the far left. This occurs because Y. Liu, et al. Sci.

CHIME’s bandwidth is restricted to 400 MHz, causing tens of FRBs with an actual bandwidth exceeding 400 MHz to be accumulated in this bin. To compute the probability, we first normalize the equa-tion to center it around 0 and scale it to make its variance in the order of 1, then apply the Sigmoid function of equation 18. Our regression method optimizes this normalization as ¯ΘNDR = ΘNDR − 77 15 .4 . (23) Here, the constant 77 shifts the distribution, while the factor 1/15 .4 scales it. This normalization does not a ff ect the classi-fication capability of the equation. The bursts with ¯ ΘNDR ≤ 0are classified as non-repeaters, while ¯ ΘNDR > 0 are classified as repeaters. 

4.4 NDR: Physical Interpretation 

Equation 22 shows that classification is related to νp, ∆ν, δt,and α, but independent of DM and f . Since DM serves as a proxy for redshift z, it implies the two FRB classes do not exhibit significant di ff erences in their cosmological distribu-tions. Given that currently observed FRBs are within z < 1, future observations at higher redshifts may clarify whether this trend persists or diverges. The flux ( f ), which corre-lates with intrinsic luminosity and distance, further implies that the two classes lack statistically significant di ff erences in luminosity. If their redshift distributions are similar from above discussion, this suggests that their energy scales and emission mechanisms may originate from progenitors with comparable energy reservoirs, such as magnetars or neutron stars. The parameters νp, ∆ν, and α describe the spectral charac-teristics, while ∆t represents the burst duration. These quan-tities are related to radiation mechanisms, the physical scale of the emission process, and the duration of active central engine. From the equation, its value increases as the di ff er-ence ( νp − ∆ν) and the ratio ( νp/∆ν) between the spectral peak frequency and bandwidth, as well as the spectral index ( α)and the duration ( δt), increase. This suggests that repeaters tend to exhibit higher-frequency, narrower, steeper spectra and longer durations compared to non-repeaters. In contrast, non-repeaters tend to exhibit broader spectral widths, flatter spectra, and shorter durations. This conclusion aligns with the previous discussion based on equation 20. It is interesting to notice DM , representing redshift, is ab-sent in the equation 22 while having high rankings during the feature selection. This discrepancy may arise from di ff er-ences between traditional neural network and symbolic equa-tion. A neural network, with its many layers and interconnected nodes, acts as a complex formula of thousands or even mil-lions of parameters. It learns complex, nonlinear relation-ships between the six input parameters (including DM and 

f ) and the FRB classification. The SHAP values for feature selection provide relative importance within the network’s learned representation, not necessarily the absolute impor-tance in the underlying physics. The neural network needs 

DM because it’s a proxy for redshift, which a ff ects other observables and highly involved in computation. Moreover, our data contain uncertainties and observational limitations, which further prevent the neural network from clearly eval-uating the contribution of the highly entangled DM and to eliminate it. Our derived equation, however, identifies that only peak frequency ( νp), bandwidth ( ∆ν), spectral index ( α), and du-ration ( ∆t) are fundamental parameters. They combine in a redshift-independent manner due to opposing scaling from cosmic expansion: νp and ∆ν scale as (1 + z)−1, ∆t scales as Y. Liu, et al. Sci. China-Phys. Mech. Astron. () Vol. No. -13

The stacked histogram shows Catalog 1 repeaters (black) and non-repeaters (grey), with hatched regions indicating sources constrained by the bandwidth limit ( ∆ν=400 MHz). The orange histogram represents Catalog 2 repeaters. The solid color curves show the individual Gaussian components of the bimodal fit (Brown: Gaussian 1 enclosing repeaters; Green: Gaussian 2 enclosing non-repeaters), while the solid black line shows their sum. This bimodal distribution suggests two distinct populations within the FRB sample.

(1 + z), and α remains una ff ected. The terms ( νp − ∆ν)∆t and 

νp/∆ν mathematically cancel (1 + z) dependencies. Conse-quently, DM , which encodes redshift information, becomes unnecessary for this simple equation. As more samples are included in the future observations, the DM term may enter into more detailed equations. This highlights the di ff erence between neural networks and symbolic regression. A complex neural network cannot eliminate quantities that are indirectly involved in computa-tions but ultimately irrelevant to the final result. In contrast, a concise mathematical equation can eliminate such dependen-cies. 

4.5 Application on 2nd Catalog 

In 2023, CHIME released its second repeater-only FRB cat-alog (Catalog 2), see Section 2.1 for details. We applied the equations derived using the power-law multiplication and NDR method to the 119 sub-bursts of this new catalog. The power-law multiplication, Equation 20, infers 87 re-peaters, achieving a recall 6) of 0.73, which is lower than its recall of 0.91 on catalog 1. The NDR method, Equation 22, achieves a recall of 0.85, which is close to its recall of 0.87 on catalog 1. See Figure 10 for the results. It is remark-able that Equation 22, a simple equation composed of only four observational parameters, achieves such a high accuracy, especially considering that the data itself is constrained and contains uncertainties, as well as the catalog itself could be misclassified. The equation derived from power-law multiplication, which incorporates all six parameters, performed exception-ally well on Catalog 1 but exhibits a noticeable decline in performance on Catalog 2. In contrast, the equation derived from NDR demonstrates greater stability. This suggests that the power-law multiplication equation may be prone to over-fitting on Catalog 1, reducing its generalizability. Such an issue is commonly observed when the dataset is small, par-ticularly with only 18 independent DM measured, and when the data is imprecise due to instrumental limitations and mea-surement errors. In contrast, the simpler equation derived from NDR ap-pears to be more aligned with the fundamental physics un-derlying classification. Additionally, it partitions the data into two distributions. When we plot the Catalog 2 results on Fig-ure 9, the data points fall within the distribution of repeaters of Catalog 1, further suggesting that this equation may have some capacity to reflect two distinct physical processes. As a robustness check, Appendix Appendix A shows that      

> 6) Since catalog 2 contains only repeaters, recall is equivalent to accuracy. Y. Liu, et al. Sci. China-Phys. Mech. Astron. () Vol. No.

Figure 10 Confusion matrices, recall, and F2 scores for power-law multiplication and NDR methods for catalog 2 classification, which include repeaters only.

Upper-Right: Recall and F2 score for power-law multiplication at varying thresholds; green (non-repeaters), brown (repeaters), grey vertical line (threshold = 0.5).

our NDR equation recovers 5 /6 Catalog-2 repeaters previ-ously labeled non-repeating in Catalog 1. In Appendix Ap-pendix B, we present a list of repeater candidates derived from the NDR equation and cross-validate it against the re-sults of [25, 39]. From a statistical perspective, the overall distribution of categories carries more significance. Even if some data la-bels are incorrect, a meaningful distribution can still emerge as long as the majority are correctly classified. This distri-bution serves as an important reference for assessing whether unsure bursts, those repeaters classified as non-repeaters due to inadequate observational time for confirmation, are clas-sified correctly. We also need to note that the two distribu-tions still overlap, indicating that the equation cannot pro-vide a definitive classification for samples with derived val-ues near zero. This situation is similar to GRB classifica-tion using T90 , where two slightly overlapping distributions correspond to di ff erent GRB origins. However, GRBs near the 2 s threshold cannot be perfectly distinguished using T90 

alone and require additional criteria, such as the presence of a supernova or kilonova. If FRBs indeed have two or more distinct origins, future observations in other wavebands may reveal additional distinguishing evidence. 

## 5 Conclusion and Discussion 

In this work, we demonstrated how human expertise and machine learning can synergize to derive interpretable phe-nomenological equations, and gave the example of classify-ing FRBs based solely on physical observables from CHIME telescope. First, the neural network helped identify the top six obser-vational parameters, emerged from 48 observational param-eters, including spectral index ( α), sub-burst duration ( ∆t), dispersion measure (DM), flux density ( f ), frequency band-width ( ∆ν), and peak frequency ( νp). These parameters pro-vide a comprehensive description of FRB observations, each Y. Liu, et al. Sci. China-Phys. Mech. Astron. () Vol. No. -15 

of them plays a unique role that cannot be substituted by an-other, suggesting that the mechanisms behind repeating and non-repeating FRBs could be distinct. Then we search for the equations using these six param-eters by two methods. For the equation 20 made of power-laws multiplication, we achieved F2 score of 0 .88 and a re-call rate of 0 .91. Its power-law indices reveal that repeat-ing bursts tend to exhibit steeper spectral indices ( α), higher peak frequencies ( νp), narrower bandwidths ( ∆ν), and longer durations ( ∆t). In contrast, non-repeating bursts showed the opposite spectral trends. To further investigate the underlying physics and the nonlinear relationships between parameters. We propose a second approach, neural dimensional regression, which combines human prior knowledge with machine learning. Through an initial dimensionless processing, this method re-duces the number of parameters and significantly decreases the computational complexity, it also ensures the dimension consistency that the traditional symbolic regression may find problem. Based on Buckingham’s π-theorem, we selected high-impact, low-nonlinearity parameters as repeating vari-ables and constructed four dimensionless groups: π1 = ∆ ν∆t,

π2 = νp∆t, π3 = f ∆t/(hDM), and π4 = α. Then by the symbolic regression (using the PySR library), we obtained a simple but highly performing equation 22 with an F2 score of 0 .82 and a recall rate of 0 .87. Critically, this NDR equa-tion partitioned FRBs into two distinct Gaussian distributions (Figure 9), similar to GRB’s T90 based classification, suggest-ing two origins. We then apply the equations on the second CHIME cata-log which only contains repeaters. The NDR-based equation achieved a recall of 0 .85, maintaining stability across cata-logs, indicating that it is less influenced by dataset variations and may capture underlying physical principles. The Power-law multiplication equation drops to 0 .73, suggesting it is mildly over-fitted for the first catalog. The classification out-put of the second catalog using the NDR equation falls within the repeater distribution of the first catalog, further validating the equation’s physical significance and confirming the two classes. We acknowledge potential limitations. For the observa-tions, the classification is derived from CHIME data within the 400–800 MHz band. Its applicability to data from instru-ments observing at di ff erent frequencies requires verification. Furthermore, sample sizes for some parameters, particularly the DM values for repeaters, remain limited as fewer than 20. For the results, this work concludes that there are two classes of FRBs based on the currently available limited data. How-ever, it does not determine whether these classes arise from distinct progenitor systems, from a single progenitor with dif-ferent emission mechanisms, or from a common mechanism operating under varying physical conditions, such as active and inactive phases. These possibilities will be investigated in future work. In conclusion, this work exemplifies how human-driven physical reasoning, dimensional homogeneity, nonlinear in-teraction analysis, and Occam’s Razor, can steer symbolic re-gression toward robust, interpretable laws. Bridging machine learning’s pattern recognition with domain knowledge helps advance the search for fundamental physical descriptions in complex astrophysical datasets. Future work incorporating polarimetry, multi-wavelength data, and more samples could further refine these laws, probing the progenitor systems be-hind FRB diversity.

## Appendix A Robustness to Label Noise 

Repeating bursts reported in Catalog 2 include six special samples that had previously been classified as non-repeating bursts in Catalog 1. Since non-repeating burst data may be subject to observational biases, these samples provide an ideal probe for testing the robustness of our classifi-cation model. The NDR equation we developed success-fully identified five out of six repeaters, as shown in Ta-ble A2, achieving a score among the best compared with ex-isting machine learning approaches [25, 31, 39-41]. Notably, FRB20180910A was consistently classified as a non-repeater across all methodologies examined in this comparative anal-ysis, including our own. Y. Liu, et al. Sci. China-Phys. Mech. Astron.

## Appendix B Repeater Candidates 

We predict potential repeater candidates using the NDR equa-tion. To take advantage of existing studies and provide a cross-check for our predictions, we compare the NDR-predicted list with candidate lists reported in [39] and [25]. Specifically, we construct a cross-validated list by taking the intersection of all three. The NDR equation predicts 85 can-didates. The method in [25] predicts 65 candidates, with 30 overlapping with the NDR results. The model in [39] iden-tifies 27 candidates, with 21 overlapping with the NDR re-sults. The three-way intersection yields 17 candidates, which can be considered as high-confidence candidates. Detailed classifications are provided in Table 3.
