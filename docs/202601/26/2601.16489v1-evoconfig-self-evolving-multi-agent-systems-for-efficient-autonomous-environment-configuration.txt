Abstract 

A reliable executable environment is the foun-dation for ensuring that large language mod-els solve software engineering tasks. Due to the complex and tedious construction process, large-scale configuration is relatively ineffi-cient. However, most methods always over-look fine-grained analysis of the actions per-formed by the agent, making it difficult to han-dle complex errors and resulting in configura-tion failures. To address this bottleneck, we propose EvoConfig, an efficient environment configuration framework that optimizes multi-agent collaboration to build correct runtime en-vironments. EvoConfig features an expert di-agnosis module for fine-grained post-execution analysis, and a self-evolving mechanism that lets expert agents self-feedback and dynami-cally adjust error-fixing priorities in real time. Empirically, EvoConfig matches the previous state-of-the-art Repo2Run on Repo2Run’s 420 repositories, while delivering clear gains on harder cases: on the more challenging En-vbench, EvoConfig achieves a 78.1% suc-cess rate, outperforming Repo2Run by 7.1%. Beyond end-to-end success, EvoConfig also demonstrates stronger debugging competence, achieving higher accuracy in error identifica-tion and producing more effective repair rec-ommendations than existing methods 1.

1 Introduction 

Large language models (LLMs) have made rapid progress in handling complex software engineer-ing (SWE) tasks (He et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025c; Xia et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2024a; Kuang et al., 2025a; Lu et al., 2025), leading to the emer-gence of a wide range of code agents such as SWE-Agent (Yang et al., 2024), OpenHands (Wang

et al., 2024b), MetaGPT (Hong et al., 2023), Copi-lot (GitHub, 2021) and Cursor (Anysphere, 2023). As research increasingly shifts toward repository-level software engineering tasks, scalable execution and reliable validation become essential (Wang et al., 2025a; Xie et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Rutherford et al., 2024; Krnjaic et al., 2024). Code agents are no longer required to only generate or modify code, but must also complete end-to-end workflows, including environment construction, testing, and validation, within real code runtime environments. However, a long-overlooked chal-lenge is now becoming increasingly evident: au-tomatically configuring executable environments. Environment setup still depends heavily on human expertise and can be difficult even for experienced developers. Yet a stable, runnable environment is a prerequisite for tackling complex software engi-neering tasks. Therefore, enabling agents to reli-ably configure environments is critical to advanc-ing code agents .In real-world repositories, an agent must au-1

tonomously complete dependency installation, ver-sion resolution, and test execution under challeng-ing conditions, including unknown dependencies, incomplete documentation, and the coexistence of multiple build tools. Most existing methods for-mulate environment configuration as a sequential decision-making problem (Bouzenia and Pradel, 2025a; Vergopoulos et al., 2025; Hu et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025a): the agent observes the cur-rent execution outcome and heuristically proposes the next action. However, these approaches often fail to explicitly address process-level errors that occur during configuration (e.g., cascading de-pendency conflicts, toolchain mismatches, partial installations). Such errors can accumulate across steps and ultimately cause environment construc-tion to fail. Some prior work (Milliken et al., 2025a; Vergopoulos et al., 2025) introduces repair strate-gies that are detached from the original configura-tion context. These methods typically rely on pre-defined, experience-based rules to produce static repair actions, but they lack fine-grained diagno-sis of the specific failure causes in the ongoing configuration process . Consequently, agents are more prone to hallucinated fixes or repetitive trial-and-error behaviors, and may even fall into infinite loops when confronted with complex failures. In addition, the single-agent workflow exacerbates the problem: error-related information and noisy execution traces accumulate over time, which can mislead subsequent decisions and further reduce both success rate and efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose Evo-Config, an efficient environment configuration framework based on self-evolving multi-agent col-laboration. Our core objective is to improve envi-ronment configuration success rates while simul-taneously enhancing process-level error correc-tion capabilities during the configuration pro-cess . Specifically, a main agent is responsible for environment configuration, while expert agents act as diagnostic specialists that perform fine-grained analysis of execution results and autonomously de-termine whether repairs are required, ultimately providing structured and actionable guidance to the main agent. More importantly, we introduce an online self-evolving mechanism that enables expert agents to continuously learn from error correction cases and dynamically adjust their analytical fo-cus and structured suggestions, thereby improving the agent’s ability to resolve complex environment configuration failures. Notably, this self-evolving mechanism does not rely on external memory mod-ules, avoiding additional reasoning overhead and token consumption. We evaluate EvoConfig on multiple real-world open-source repositories, and the results demonstrate that our approach not only improves environment configuration success rates but also significantly enhances process-level error correction during the configuration process. In summary, our main contributions are summa-rized as follows: • We are the first to propose the multi-agent collaborative framework EvoConfig for auto-mated environment configuration, improving configuration success rates through optimized agent workflows. • We propose an expert diagnostic module and introduce a self-evolving mechanism to adap-tively enhance the process-level error correc-tion capability of agents in the environment configuration process. • We conduct extensive evaluations on mul-tiple open-source benchmarks against ad-vanced agent frameworks, demonstrating that EvoConfig achieves state-of-the-art perfor-mance in both environment configuration and process-level error correction. 

2 Formulation 

2.1 Task Definition 

Given a real-world open-source GitHub repository 

R at a specified version, the system is provided with a clean initial execution environment E0. The ultimate goal is to automatically construct a target execution environment E through a sequence of interactive commands, such that unit tests can be successfully executed in the resulting environment. 

2.2 Iterative Configuration Process 

In this work, we model environment configuration as an interactive decision-making process. Specif-ically, at interaction round t, the agent is in the current environment state Et and selects a set of commands from the action space A for execution: 

at = {c1 

> t

, c 2 

> t

, . . . , c kt 

> t

}, at ⊆ A , (1) where each cit denotes an atomic executable com-mand, and kt is the number of commands issued at round t.2After executing the command set at, the system performs a state transition based on the current environment state and the execution outcomes: 

Et+1 = δ(Et, a t). (2) This process is repeated for at most tmax inter-action rounds, until the test cases are successfully executed or the number of interactions exceeds a predefined maximum threshold. In this work, we place particular emphasis on whether the com-mands generated at each round result in execution errors. Accordingly, the overall optimization ob-jective is to improve the environment configura-tion success rate under a limited interaction budget, while simultaneously enhancing the agent’s capa-bility for process-level error correction. 

3 Method 

This section introduces EvoConfig, a self-evolving multi-agent framework for efficient environment configuration. Given a code repository, EvoCon-fig performs multiple rounds of interaction and decision-making while continuously repairing envi-ronment configuration issues, ultimately generating an executable Dockerfile to build a runnable envi-ronment. EvoConfig consists of three main com-ponents: an environment information extraction module, a main environment configuration module, and an self-evolving expert diagnosis module. 

3.1 Environment Info Extraction Module 

We introduce a lightweight environment informa-tion extraction module that provides the main agent with a small set of high-impact prior signals before interactive configuration begins. The module fo-cuses on extracting stable structural cues that are directly relevant to environment configuration. Formally, given a repository R, the module pro-duces a prior summary: 

P (R) = {M, I, T }, (3) where M , I, and T denote the dependency man-agement strategy, project importability, and test structure, respectively. 

Dependency Management Strategy. The de-pendency management strategy M is inferred from configuration files such as poetry.lock ,

pyproject.toml , and requirements*.txt , guid-ing early installation decisions. 

Project Importability. Project importability I

captures whether the project needs to be installed for tests to run, based on installation metadata, src/ 

layouts, and package structure. 

Test Structure Hypothesis. The test structure hypothesis T describes the presence and location of tests, the inferred test framework, and whether tests import project modules. The prior summary P (R) is injected into the ini-tial prompt words of the main agent to guide the generation of the initial configuration strategy of the main agent with almost no increase in compu-tational cost. 

3.2 Main Environment Configuration Module 

After the environment prior information is ex-tracted, the system enters the core environment configuration stage. Unlike previous approaches, the main agent responsible for environment con-figuration focuses solely on action execution and sequence, without bearing the burden of long-term memory and semantic analysis of execution results. Specifically, at interaction step t, the main agent performs ReAct (Yao et al., 2022) framework rea-soning based on a limited context and generates an action output, which is parsed into a sequence of atomic commands and executed sequentially in the runtime environment. Each command returns standard output and an exit code as execution feed-back for the current step. During this process, the main agent concentrates only on action generation, scheduling, and execution order, and does not di-rectly interpret the semantics of execution results. Instead, the execution context is delegated to the expert diagnosis module for analysis. This design allows the main agent to advance execution in a streaming manner, avoiding the accumulation of large volumes of raw output across multiple interac-tion rounds and receiving only highly summarized analytical feedback. As a result, it effectively miti-gates a key issue in traditional interactive systems, where incorporating large amounts of low-value output directly into the main reasoning context leads to memory inflation and interferes with sub-sequent decision-making. In addition, to maintain reasoning quality while reducing overall overhead, the main agent adopts a strict context management strategy. Combined with the system’s rollback mechanism, it preserves key command sequences from successful execution rounds as well as structured diagnostic summaries 3Github Repository

from the diagnosis module as experience, thereby improving the efficiency of action generation and scheduling during environment configuration. 

3.3 Self-Evolving Expert Diagnosis Module 

During environment configuration, accurate error diagnosis and repair are critical to ensuring success-ful system deployment. To enhance process-level error correction capability, we introduce an expert diagnosis module with a self-evolving mechanism, which explicitly decouples the standard output of execution actions from the primary configuration workflow and assigns it to an independent expert diagnostic agent. The critical function of the expert agent is to assess the outcomes of execution actions and pro-duce fine-grained analytical results. Specifically, based on the executed command, exit code, and standard output, the expert agent categorizes each action into one of three states— success , failure , or 

potential risk . According to the identified state, it generates corresponding repair commands or risk suggestions, and ultimately outputs a structured diagnostic report. Notably, the expert agent is endowed with the capability of on-the-live tool creation and execu-tion. At each decision step, the agent autonomously determines whether auxiliary tools are needed to support error judgment. Tool creation is subject to strict constraints: each tool must be a single-line executable command used solely for collecting diagnostic evidence rather than performing repairs. The outputs of these tools are treated as diagnostic evidence to strengthen error interpretation and are fed back to the main agent in a structured form. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of a self-evolving mechanism . After each diagnostic cycle, the expert agent incrementally adjusts its internal rules based on feedback signals. These rules pri-marily govern repair suggestion generation, tool creation, and risk assessment. Through continuous evolution driven by historical experience, the ex-pert agent progressively refines its decision-making process and becomes capable of handling increas-ingly complex configuration errors. 

4 Experimental Setup 

We evaluate EvoConfig from two complemen-tary perspectives: environment build success and process-level error correction capability. 

4.1 Environment Build Success Evaluation Dataset and Baselines. We evaluate environ-ment construction on 420 Repo2Run reposito-ries (Hu et al., 2025) and 324 Python repos-itories from EnvBench (Eliseeva et al., 2025), excluding 5 EnvBench repositories larger than 200MB. All experiments follow the Repo2Run pro-tocol and compare EvoConfig with pipreqs (bndr, 2016), LLM Generator , SWE-agent (Yang et al., 2024), and Repo2Run (Hu et al., 2025). We use gpt-4o-2024-05-13 , GPT-3.5-turbo , and 

GPT-4o-mini , with a 2-hour time limit and up to 100 interaction rounds. Additional details are pro-vided in Appendix A. 4Method Backbone DGSR # Successfully EBSR # Successfully Generated Dockerfiles Built Environments

Table 2: Performance comparison under different back-bone models on the 324 repositories from EnvBench. Results for gpt-4o-mini are obtained on a randomly sampled subset of 30 repositories. 

Evaluation Metrics. We use two metrics to eval-uate environment construction. DGSR measures the percentage of attempts that generate a runnable Dockerfile that builds without errors, while EBSR 

measures the percentage of attempts that success-fully build executable environments, requiring both a successful Dockerfile build and the ability to exe-cute tests with pytest , regardless of test outcomes. 

4.2 Process Error Correction Evaluation Dataset and Baselines. For process-level error correction evaluation, we use the EnConda-Bench dataset (Kuang et al., 2025b), which is designed to assess an agent’s ability to diagnose errors and recover from failed configuration steps during inter-active execution. We evaluate all 4,201 instances provided by EnConda-Bench and compare Evo-Config against representative baselines, including 

SWE-Agent , OpenHands (Wang et al., 2024b), 

INSTALLAMATIC (Milliken et al., 2025a), and 

Repo2Run (Hu et al., 2025), using GPT-4.1 and 

DeepSeek-V3 (Liu et al., 2023) as the underlying language models. More details about our selected baselines are provided in Appendix B. 

Evaluation Metrics. We follow the evaluation protocol and metrics defined in EnConda-Bench, which measure an agent’s capability from error per-ception to corrective execution. Specifically, the metrics include error classification precision and recall, error description accuracy and fix accuracy. Each agent interacts with the execution environ-ment step by step, generates diagnostic feedback and repair actions upon failure, and is evaluated based on both the correctness of intermediate error handling and the final recovery outcome. 

5 Result Analysis 

5.1 Main Results Environment Construction Success Analysis. 

The results of different baselines are presented in Table 1. Results of all baselines except EvoConfig are taken from the original Repo2Run benchmark to ensure a fair comparison. We observe that EvoConfig achieves an environ-ment building success rate that is comparable to, and slightly higher than, Repo2Run on the origi-nal set of 420 repositories. EvoConfig successfully builds executable environments for 370 reposito-ries (EBSR 88.1%), compared to 361 repositories (EBSR 86.0%) built by Repo2Run. Given the al-ready strong performance of Repo2Run, this im-provement suggests that EvoConfig can recover a small but non-negligible fraction of failure cases that remain challenging for existing environment configuration agents. EvoConfig also maintains a DGSR of 100%, matching Repo2Run and con-firming that robust rollback and verification mech-anisms are preserved, while other baselines fail to consistently guarantee Dockerfile buildability. Table 2 further presents environment building performance under different language model back-bones. For gpt-3.5-turbo , EvoConfig improves EBSR from 71.0% to 78.1%, corresponding to 23 additional repositories successfully configured. We also present results using gpt-4o-mini , evaluated on a randomly sampled subset of 30 repositories due to computational constraints. This result indi-cates that the advantages of EvoConfig generalize 5Method Backbone Perception Feedback Feedback and Action

across different model backbones. 

Process-level Error Correction Analysis. We evaluate process-level error correction results on EnConda-Bench in Table 3. EvoConfig demon-strates consistently stronger performance across both error perception and repair-related metrics, indicating improved handling of configuration fail-ures during interactive execution. We observe that code agents such as SWE-Agent and OpenHands show improved error perception compared to generic agents, but their ability to translate diagnosis into effective repair actions re-mains limited. For instance, OpenHands with DeepSeek-V3 achieves an error type F1 score of 58.7 and an error description accuracy of 51.9, while its fix suggestion accuracy is only 33.8, in-dicating a clear gap between error understand-ing and action-level repair. Environment con-figuration agents further improve repair effec-tiveness: INSTALLAMATIC increases fix accu-racy to 32.5, and Repo2Run reaches 41.2 under DeepSeek-V3, demonstrating the benefit of ex-plicitly modeling environment interaction. Evo-Config consistently achieves the strongest perfor-mance across both backbones, reaching error type F1 scores of 59.7/62.6 and fix suggestion accura-cies of 39.4/45.9 under GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3, respectively. These results suggest that EvoCon-fig better aligns fine-grained error analysis with actionable repair guidance, highlighting the value of adaptive, expert-driven diagnosis in improving process-level error correction.

5.2 Ablation Study 

We conduct ablation studies on a randomly sampled set of 100 repositories from EnvBench to examine the contributions of the environment information extraction module and the self-evolving expert di-agnosis module, with additional details provided in Appendix C. As shown in Table 4, removing the self-evolving expert diagnosis module leads to a substantial drop in environment building success rate (EBSR) from 83.0% to 75.0%, while remov-ing the environment information extraction module results in a smaller decrease to 82.0%. The runtime comparison in Figure 3, measured on 30 reposito-ries successfully configured by all variants, further shows that EvoConfig consistently achieves lower average configuration time. In particular, disabling environment information extraction leads to longer execution trajectories, whereas removing expert di-agnosis causes the most significant slowdown and higher variance, indicating repeated and inefficient repair attempts. These results suggest that envi-62 4 6 8 10

ronment information extraction mainly improves efficiency, while adaptive diagnosis is critical for robustness and success. To further evaluate the effectiveness of the self-evolving expert diagnosis module at the process level, we conduct a focused ablation study on EnConda-Bench using DeepSeek-V3, with results shown in Figure 4. The evaluation is performed on all instances from a randomly sampled set of 100 repositories, and more detailed analysis is provided in Appendix D. Removing the diagnosis module consistently degrades performance across all stages of error handling, with the error description accu-racy decreasing from 48.3 to 44.1, and fix sugges-tion accuracy declining from 45.9 to 41.0. Notably, the performance gap is most pronounced in fix sug-gestion accuracy, indicating that without adaptive expert feedback, the agent struggles to translate er-ror understanding into effective corrective actions. In contrast, EvoConfig maintains a more consistent perception feedback action performance, indicat-ing that the self evolving diagnostic mechanism enhances error correction ability of agent at the process-level while ensuring environment configu-ration success rate. 

6 Discussion 

6.1 Efficiency and Cost Analysis 

As shown in Table 5, experiments on the 324 En-vBench repositories show that EvoConfig substan-tially improves both aspects: it reduces the average Error description Fix suggestion

configuration time per repository from 30.5 min-utes to 20.9 minutes and incurs lower token-level and monetary cost under gpt-3.5-turbo . These gains are largely attributable to EvoConfig’s multi-agent design, which separates execution control from error diagnosis and feedback interpretation, preventing long execution traces from repeatedly entering the main agent’s context and thereby re-ducing redundant reasoning during configuration. 

6.2 Failure Case Study 

We analyze the failure cases of EvoConfig on the EnvBench benchmark, with the distribution sum-marized in Table 6. Most failures are caused by external execution constraints or repository-intrinsic issues rather than limitations of the agent itself. Hardware insufficiency is the most com-mon failure source, accounting for 32.4% of failed cases, followed by missing or incomplete configu-ration information (28.2%), where repositories lack core files such as pyproject.toml , setup.py , or 

requirements.txt . A further portion of failures arises from execution timeouts during dependency installation or test execution, reflecting practical limits imposed by heavy dependencies and long-running tests.

Ex-7ecutable environments are a prerequisite for repository-level SWE agents, because both train-ing signals and evaluation protocols assume that projects can be built and their verification proce-dures can be executed reproducibly. Accordingly, environment configuration is deeply embedded in popular benchmarks and data pipelines: several widely-used settings rely on manual, repository-specific environment curation, such as SWE-bench (Jimenez et al., 2024), SWE-Flow (Zhang et al., 2025b), SWE-Gym (Pan et al., 2025), and R2E-Gym (Jain et al., 2025). Recent bench-mark and data construction workflows increas-ingly incorporate automated or semi-automated environment synthesis as a critical stage, includ-ing SetupAgent (Vergopoulos et al., 2025), SWE-smith (Yang et al., 2025), SWE-Factory (Guo et al., 2025), SWE-bench-Live (Zhang et al., 2025c), SWE-Compass (Xu et al., 2025a), and SWE-Bench++ (Wang et al., 2025b). Collectively, these trends motivate environment synthesis as a first-class research problem that directly controls the scalability and reliability of executable SWE data. 

Methods for automated environment setup. 

Automated setup methods broadly fall into de-terministic and agentic families (Li et al., 2024a, 2025b,c; Kuang et al., 2025c; Ye et al., 2025). De-terministic approaches implement setup as auto-mated scripts or fixed pipelines, which execute standardized procedures across diverse reposito-ries to maximize reproducibility and reduce per-repository manual effort; a representative example is R2E (Jain et al., 2024), which instantiates exe-cutable test environments via scripted setup pro-cedures. EnvBench (Eliseeva et al., 2025) spans both families: it introduces a benchmark for auto-mated environment setup, includes a determinis-tic shell-script baseline, and also evaluates LLM-based Bash agents under the same task definition and proxy-based verification signals. Template-guided container synthesis constrains Dockerfile structure while leaving repository-specific slots to be filled, improving robustness at scale in SWE-Bench++ (Wang et al., 2025b). Agentic approaches treat setup as interactive search-and-repair: an LLM agent retrieves commands from documen-tation and project artifacts, executes them in a sand-box, diagnoses failures from logs, and iteratively refines the plan, as done in SetupAgent (Vergopou-los et al., 2025) and in the RepoLaunch pipeline of SWE-bench-Live (Zhang et al., 2025c); SWE-Factory adopts multi-agent decomposition and en-vironment reuse to amortize successful configu-rations (Guo et al., 2025). Related systems tar-get key subroutines, including scalable export of runnable Docker environments in Repo2Run (Hu et al., 2025), installation under incomplete docu-mentation in Installamatic (Milliken et al., 2025b), and test execution for arbitrary projects in Exe-cutionAgent (Bouzenia and Pradel, 2025b), while earlier dependency inference in DockerizeMe illus-trates the limits of purely static signals (Horton and Parnin, 2019). 

Benchmarks that evaluate environment setup ability. With the rapid development in the field of LLMs (Li et al., 2025a; Chen et al., 2025b; Huang et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2025d; Liu et al., 2022; Du et al., 2024; Li et al., 2022, 2023, 2025e; Xu et al., 2025b; Yu et al., 2024), a complementary line of work elevates environment bootstrapping into a first-class benchmarked capa-bility (Miao et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025d; Chen et al., 2025a). EnvBench (Eliseeva et al., 2025) provides a large-scale benchmark for repository-specific setup across Python and JVM projects and introduces automatic proxy metrics such as missing-import and compilation checks to sup-port scalable evaluation. SetupBench (Arora et al., 2025) formalizes bootstrapping from a bare Linux sandbox with deterministic one-line verification commands, enabling fine-grained analysis of fail-ure modes such as incomplete toolchains and non-persistent modifications. Enconda-bench (Kuang et al., 2025b) moves beyond end-to-end success by scoring process-level trajectories and diagnosing capabilities such as setup planning, error localiza-tion, and feedback-driven repair under realistically perturbed instructions. SWE-Compass (Xu et al., 2025a) incorporates configuration and deployment tasks into a broader agentic coding evaluation suite, contextualizing setup as part of end-to-end agent behavior. Finally, Multi-Docker-Eval (Fu et al., 2025) expands evaluation to multi-language reposi-tories and emphasizes both effectiveness and effi-ciency, including time and resource usage as well as resulting image size. 

8 Conclusion 

In this paper, we propose EvoConfig, a self-evolving multi-agent framework that decouples execution, diagnosis, and repair. By combin-ing lightweight environment information extrac-8tion with adaptive expert diagnosis, EvoConfig improves configuration robustness and efficiency. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate strong environment building performance with re-duced time and token cost, while process-level eval-uations show improved error understanding and re-pair quality. EvoConfig focuses on enabling test execution, and extending it to reason about test outcomes remains future work. 

Limitations 

EvoConfig focuses on constructing executable en-vironments and improving process-level error cor-rection, but does not reason about test correctness. Our evaluation considers whether unit tests can be executed, rather than the proportion of tests that pass. In practice, test failures may arise from issues beyond environment configuration. While EvoCon-fig enables tests to run reliably, analyzing test out-comes and debugging failing tests remain outside its current scope and are left for future work. 

Ethical Considerations 

Potential Risks Although EvoConfig improves robustness and efficiency in automated environ-ment configuration, several risks remain. The framework depends on execution feedback qual-ity, and noisy or incomplete errors may still affect diagnosis. In addition, the self-evolving mecha-nism may require sufficient feedback to stabilize in early stages. Finally, EvoConfig focuses on build-ing runnable environments and does not guarantee the correctness of test outcomes, which may limit its use in strict functional validation settings. 

Ethical Statement This work focuses on au-tomated environment configuration for open-source software repositories using large language model–based agents. All experiments are con-ducted on publicly available data and executed in isolated environments, without involving personal, sensitive, or private information. 

LLMs Usage Statement Large language models were used to assist with language polishing and clarity improvement during the writing process; all technical content, experimental design, and conclu-sions were developed and verified by the authors. The proposed method aims to improve research re-producibility and scalability in software engineer-ing and does not introduce new ethical risks beyond those of existing automated development tools.

A Environment Build Success Evaluation 

A.1 Baselines 

We evaluate environment configuration perfor-mance using the following representative baselines: • pipreqs : A static dependency analysis tool that inspects Python import statements to infer required packages and generates a

requirements.txt file, which is then used to construct a Dockerfile. • LLM Generator : A direct LLM-based ap-proach that parses repository README files and generates executable Dockerfiles without iter-ative interaction. • SWE-agent : An LLM-based agent with a cus-tom agent–computer interface that supports file inspection, editing, and command execu-tion; its framework is retained while prompts are adapted for environment configuration. • Repo2Run : A strong agent-based baseline specifically designed for iterative environment configuration through interaction with the ex-ecution environment. 12 Method Backbone Perception Feedback Feedback and Action

B Process Error Correction Evaluation 

To evaluate process-level error correction, we com-pare EvoConfig with several representative agent-based baselines that support iterative interaction with the execution environment. • SWE-agent : An LLM-based agent originally designed for automated bug fixing, which supports file inspection, code editing, and command execution through a custom agent– computer interface. We adapt its prompts for process-level environment error correction. • OpenHands : A general-purpose autonomous agent framework for software engineering tasks, used here as a generic baseline to as-sess its ability to correct environment errors through multi-step interaction. • INSTALLAMATIC : An LLM-driven system that focuses on generating installation and setup commands for resolving dependency-related environment issues, without explicit long-horizon agent planning. • Repo2Run : A specialized agent-based sys-tem for repository environment configuration. 

C Time Efficiency Analysis 

We analyze environment building success rates (EBSR) and time efficiency of different variants, as reported in Table 7. EvoConfig achieves both the highest success rate (83.0%) and the lowest average configuration time (20.5 minutes), indicating that its improved performance does not come at the cost of increased runtime. In contrast, removing the en-vironment information extraction module slightly reduces the success rate to 82.0% while increasing the average configuration time to 22.5 minutes, sug-gesting that limited environment awareness leads to inefficient trial-and-error and correspondingly longer execution trajectories. Specifically, the success rate drops substantially to 75.0%, accompanied by a significant increase in average configuration time to 27.2 minutes. This observation indicates that static diagnosis strategies not only reduce the likelihood of successful envi-ronment construction but also result in repeated and inefficient repair attempts, thereby prolonging the overall configuration process. Together, these results demonstrate that while environment infor-mation extraction mainly contributes to execution efficiency, adaptive expert diagnosis is crucial for achieving both high configuration success rates and low configuration time. 

D Effect of Self-Evolving Expert Diagnosis 

We evaluate the contribution of the self-evolving expert diagnosis module by comparing the full EvoConfig framework with a variant that removes this component while using the same backbone (DeepSeek-V3). As shown in Table 8, removing self-evolving diagnosis results in a consistent per-formance degradation across all evaluation stages, indicating its critical role in the overall system. From the perception perspective, the absence of self-evolving diagnosis leads to a noticeable drop in error type recognition performance, with the F1 score decreasing from 62.6 to 55.1, mainly due to reduced precision. This suggests that static ex-pert behavior limits the agent’s ability to accurately identify error patterns. Moreover, the accuracy of error description generation also declines from 48.3% to 44.1%, reflecting less precise feedback when adaptive diagnosis is disabled. The impact is further reflected in the action stage, where fix suggestion accuracy drops from 45.9% to 41.0%. Since effective repair actions rely on accu-rate error understanding, these results demonstrate that self-evolving expert diagnosis is an essential component for maintaining coherent perception– feedback–action alignment in large-scale environ-ment configuration. 13
