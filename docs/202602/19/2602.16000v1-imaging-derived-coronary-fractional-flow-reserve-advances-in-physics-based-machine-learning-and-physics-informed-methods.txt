Purpose of Review Imaging-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR) is rapidly evolving beyond conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based pipelines toward machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and physics-informed approaches that enable fast, wire-free, and scalable functional assessment of coronary stenosis. This review synthesizes recent advances in CT- and angiography-based FFR, with particular emphasis on emerging physics-informed neural networks and neural operators (PINNs and PINOs) and key considerations for their clinical translation. 

Recent Findings ML/DL approaches have markedly improved automation and computational speed, enabling prediction of pressure and FFR from anatomical descriptors or angiographic contrast dynamics. However, their real-world performance and generalizability can remain variable and sensitive to domain shift, due to multi-center heterogeneity, interpretability challenges, and differences in acquisition protocols and image quality. Physics-informed learning introduces conservation structure and boundary-condition consistency into model training, improving generalizability and reducing dependence on dense supervision while maintaining rapid inference. Recent evaluation trends increasingly highlight deployment-oriented metrics, including calibration, uncertainty quantification, and quality-control gatekeeping, as essential for safe clinical use. 

Summary The field is converging toward imaging-derived FFR methods that are faster, more automated, and more reliable. While ML/DL offers substantial efficiency gains, physics-informed frameworks such as PINNs and PINOs may provide a more robust balance between speed and physical consistency. Prospective multi-center validation and standardized evaluation will be critical to support broad and safe clinical adoption.

1.1 Clinical background and motivation 

Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. A central clinical challenge is to distinguish anatomically visible stenosis from functionally significant lesions that truly cause ischemia, particularly for intermediate disease where visual assessment is subjective and variable. Pressure-wire fractional flow reserve (FFR), measured under maximal hyperemia, is widely regarded as the invasive reference standard for lesion-specific physiological assessment and for guiding revascularization decisions [1-2]. 

Despite its clinical value, routine pressure-wire FFR is not universally adopted in daily practice. Practical barriers include wire manipulation, the need for hyperemic agents, additional procedure time and cost, and patient- or operator-related constraints [3]. These limitations have motivated the development of wire-free, imaging-derived physiological assessment—aiming to provide actionable functional information with reduced procedural burden while preserving lesion-level decision support. 

In this review, we focus on non-invasive imaging-derived approaches that infer coronary hemodynamics and functional significance from routinely acquired imaging, with an emphasis on methods that can realistically integrate into clinical workflows and provide reliable outputs under heterogeneous image quality, acquisition protocols, and lesion morphologies. 

1.2 Imaging -based alternatives to invasive FFR 

Imaging-derived functional assessment leverages anatomical and/or contrast-flow information to estimate pressure drop and physiological significance along the coronary tree. Among available modalities, clinical translation and large-scale evidence have been most prominent for computed tomography coronary angiography (CCTA) and invasive coronary angiography (ICA), each with distinct strengths and constraints. 

CCTA -based functional assessment (CT -derived FFR): CCTA provides a patient-specific 3D representation of the coronary anatomy and plaque burden, enabling physiologic assessment across the vascular tree. CT-derived FFR has demonstrated diagnostic value relative to invasive FFR and has been positioned as a noninvasive strategy to improve patient triage beyond anatomy alone [3-6]. However, real-world feasibility can be limited by image quality and reconstruction challenges (e.g., motion artifacts, noise, heavy calcification or stent blooming), as well as sensitivity to segmentation and centerline uncertainties. Consequently, practical adoption depends not only on diagnostic accuracy but also on computability, quality control, and robust handling of imperfect inputs [7-8]. Cardiac CT artifact mechanisms and mitigation strategies (including blooming and other physics-driven artifacts) have been comprehensively discussed elsewhere [9-10]. 

Angiography -based functional assessment (ICA -derived physiology): ICA is routinely performed for diagnosis and procedural planning in the catheterization laboratory. A major clinical motivation for ICA-derived physiology is to provide wire-free functional information within the cath-lab time budget, supporting immediate decision-making without advancing a pressure wire. Quantitative flow ratio (QFR) and related approaches have reported strong agreement with invasive FFR in validation studies, and randomized evidence has supported QFR-guided strategies [11-12]. In practice, angiography-derived methods are highly dependent on acquisition conditions, including adequate projection separation, minimal foreshortening/overlap, and stable contrast opacification; real-world studies and head-to-head analyses have highlighted non-computability drivers and practical requirements. These workflow constraints make explicit quality control and failure-mode management integral to real-world performance [13-14]. 

1.3 A taxonomy of modern imaging -derived FFR methods 

To synthesize a rapidly growing literature, we organize imaging-derived FFR methods into three methodological families that reflect different trade-offs among fidelity, speed, interpretability, and robustness: 

(i) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and physics -based modeling: Physics-based approaches estimate pressure and flow by solving governing equations on image-derived coronary geometries. They offer mechanistic consistency and interpretability, but clinical feasibility is often constrained by computational cost and sensitivity to physiological assumptions, most notably boundary conditions and microvascular modeling [15-18]. 

(ii) Machine learning and deep learning: ML-based approaches replace part or all of the physics pipeline with data-driven inference, enabling near-instant computation and high automation. Their core challenge is reliability under dataset shift: heterogeneous scanners, protocols, image quality, and lesion morphology can degrade generalization. This has motivated increasing attention to calibration, uncertainty estimation, and deployment-aware risk management [19-22]. 

(iii) Physics -informed learning (PINNs and neural operators): Physics-informed learning aims to bridge CFD and ML by embedding physical structure (e.g., conservation laws and boundary consistency) into learning and inference [23-24]. Beyond classical pointwise PINNs, operator learning (e.g., Fourier neural operators and physics-informed neural operators) has emerged as a promising direction for improving generalization across geometries and boundary configurations with faster inference [25-26], an attractive property for scalable hemodynamic prediction and centerline-level pressure/FFR profiling. 

This taxonomy is intentionally workflow-aware: in real-world deployment, the practical value of an imaging-derived FFR method depends not only on average diagnostic metrics but also on computability, quality control, failure modes, and safe fallback strategies when inputs are insufficient or confidence is low [8,13-14]. 

1.4 Scope and contributions of this review 

Scope: This review focuses on imaging-derived FFR methods in CCTA and ICA workflows, emphasizing approaches that are clinically plausible in terms of end-to-end latency and operational requirements. We cover physics-based modeling across a fidelity spectrum (3D CFD to reduced-order models) [15-18], ML/DL approaches ranging from feature-based predictors to end-to-end inference [27-30], and physics-informed learning frameworks that integrate governing-equation structure into learning [23-26,31]. 

Contributions: We aim to provide a translation-oriented synthesis with the following contributions: 1. A workflow-grounded taxonomy spanning CCTA and angiography pipelines, mapping major methodological families to their practical trade-offs [8,13-14]. 

2. A structured overview of acceleration strategies for physics-based FFR, including reduced-order formulations and hybrid designs, and how these choices impact fidelity and feasibility [32-37]. 

3. A boundary-condition–centric perspective on uncertainty and robustness, highlighting how inlet/outlet assumptions and hyperemia modeling propagate into pressure drop and FFR [8,17,38]. 

4. An evaluation framework that extends beyond AUC/accuracy to include calibration, uncertainty, failure modes, quality-control gatekeeping, and computability—factors that strongly determine real-world adoption [19-22]. 

2. Physiological and Mathematical Foundations 

2.1 Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) 

Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is defined as the ratio of maximal hyperaemic myocardial blood flow in the presence of a stenosis to the theoretical maximal flow in the absence of that stenosis [1-2]. Under conditions of maximal hyperaemia induced by adenosine, microvascular resistances are minimized and equalized between territories, allowing flow to become directly proportional to pressure [39]. Clinically, FFR is measured as the ratio of distal coronary pressure ( 𝑃𝑃 𝑑𝑑 ) to aortic pressure ( 𝑃𝑃 𝑎𝑎 ) during maximal hyperaemia. 

FFR is mathematically defined as: 

𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 = 𝑄𝑄 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑄𝑄 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 𝑎𝑎 𝑛𝑛 

(1) 

where 𝑄𝑄 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is the maximum achievable blood flow (hyperemic flow) through a coronary artery that has a stenosis (narrowing). It represents blood flow despite the blockage, measured during maximal vasodilation (usually induced with adenosine). 𝑄𝑄 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 𝑎𝑎 𝑛𝑛 is the maximum achievable blood flow through the same artery if it were completely normal (no stenosis) under the same conditions of maximal vasodilation. 

Under maximal hyperaemia, this simplifies to [1-2]: 

𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 = 𝑃𝑃 𝑑𝑑 𝑃𝑃 𝑎𝑎 

(2) 

where 𝑃𝑃 𝑑𝑑 is the distal coronary pressure, 𝑃𝑃 𝑎𝑎 is the aortic pressure. 

An FFR value of ≤0.80 is considered hemodynamically significant and is used to guide 

revascularization decisions in clinical practice [2]. 2.2 Governing equations and modeling abstractions (full -order to reduced -order) 

FFR computations are based on a hierarchy of mathematical models, ranging from high-fidelity three-dimensional Navier–Stokes solvers to simplified reduced-order formulations. Higher-fidelity flow models provide detailed geometric representation and accurate resolution of hemodynamic features but require substantial computational resources. In contrast, reduced-order models sacrifice spatial resolution and local flow detail to achieve computational efficiency and clinical deployability. Understanding this modeling hierarchy is essential for interpreting the physics–computational spectrum underlying contemporary FFR methodologies. 

3D Navier -Stokes Equations: at the highest level of fidelity, coronary blood flow is governed by the incompressible Navier Stokes equations. Assuming blood as a Newtonian fluid with constant density 𝜌𝜌 and dynamic viscosity 𝜇𝜇 , the flow field u(x, 𝑡𝑡 ) and pressure p(x, 𝑡𝑡 ) satisfy: 

∇ ⋅ u = 0 (continuity) (3) 

𝜌𝜌 � 𝜕𝜕 u

𝜕𝜕 t + u ⋅ ∇ u� = −∇ p + 𝜇𝜇∇ 2u (momentum) (4) 

where, u(x, t) is velocity vector field and, p(x, t) pressure field, 𝜌𝜌 ≈ 1060 kg/m 3 indicating blood density, 𝜇𝜇 is blood dynamic viscosity, ∇ is gradient operator, ∇ 2 is Laplacian operator. These coupled nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) are solved over the 3D coronary geometry Ω with appropriate boundary conditions. The left-hand side of Eq. (4) represents inertial forces (acceleration), while the right-hand side balances pressure gradients and viscous forces. In coronary flow, the Reynolds number  𝐹𝐹 𝑅𝑅 = 𝜌𝜌𝜌𝜌𝜌𝜌 /𝜇𝜇 , where U is characteristic velocity,  𝜌𝜌  is vessel diameter, indicating transitional flow with both inertial and viscous effects. The Womersley number 𝛼𝛼 = 𝐹𝐹 �(𝜔𝜔 𝜌𝜌 /𝜇𝜇 ), where R is vessel radius, 𝜔𝜔 is the angular cardiac frequency, 𝜇𝜇 is dynamic viscosity, typically ranges from 1–3 in coronary arteries indicates moderate pulsatile effects, though many FFR methods assume steady-state hyperemic flow for simplicity. 

Boundary Conditions (BC): 

Solving the Navier Stokes equations requires specifying boundary conditions on the domain boundary 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 , which consists of inlet surface 𝛤𝛤 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠  , outlet surfaces 𝛤𝛤 𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑜 𝑠𝑠  -distal vessel terminations and vessel wall 𝛤𝛤 𝑤𝑤 𝑎𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛  .

At the inlet, either velocity or pressure is prescribed as follows, 

u = u in (x, t) or p = p in (t) (5) 

For steady-state FFR computation, a parabolic velocity profile with flow rate 𝑄𝑄 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠  is commonly imposed. Determining patient-specific 𝑄𝑄 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠  remains challenging and often relies on allometric scaling ( 𝑄𝑄 ∝ vessel diameter, myocardial mass) [40]. 

The vessel wall is typically treated as rigid with no-slip condition: 

u| Γ wall = 0 (6) Outlet BC: Outlet BCs represent microvascular resistance and are THE most challenging and impactful aspect of FFR modeling. Common approaches include: Zero pressure, 𝑝𝑝 = 0 at 𝛤𝛤 out, resistance BC 𝑝𝑝 = 𝐹𝐹  ⋅ 𝑄𝑄 at 𝛤𝛤 out, Windkessel (3-element) and coupled lumped network. 

RC BC : The simplest physiological BC relates pressure to flow via resistance  𝐹𝐹 𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑜 𝑠𝑠  [38]: 

p| Γ out = R out ⋅ � Γ out 

u ⋅ ndA (7) 

where n is the outward normal. Determining  𝐹𝐹 𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑜 𝑠𝑠  is non-trivial; common approaches include Murray's law:  𝐹𝐹  ∝ 𝑑𝑑 −3 and Allometric scaling:  𝐹𝐹  ∝ 𝑉𝑉 𝑛𝑛 𝑚𝑚 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑎𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠𝑜𝑜𝑛𝑛  (−3/4)

Windkessel Models (3 -Element): A more sophisticated approach couples coronary resistance ( 𝐹𝐹 𝑠𝑠  ), peripheral resistance �𝐹𝐹 𝑝𝑝 �, and arterial compliance (C) [17]. This captures pulsatile effects but requires additional parameters (  𝐹𝐹 𝑠𝑠 , 𝐹𝐹 𝑝𝑝 , 𝐶𝐶 ) that are patient-specific and difficult to measure. 

Reduced -Order Models : For computational efficiency, many FFR methods employ reduced-order models that sacrifice spatial resolution for speed while retaining essential physics [18]. 

1D Area-Averaged Flow Model: Along vessel centerline coordinate 𝑠𝑠 , cross-sectional area 𝐴𝐴 (𝑠𝑠 , 𝑡𝑡 )

where K R represents viscous resistance. Pressure-area relationship: 

p − pext = β(A − A0) (10) 

where 𝛽𝛽 relates to vessel stiffness. This 1D formulation is computationally significantly faster than full 3D Navier–Stokes simulation, enabling rapid whole-coronary-tree analysis and forming the theoretical basis of several angiography-derived FFR techniques (e.g., QFR, vFFR) [41-42]. 

0D Lumped Parameter Model: Treating each vessel segment as a resistor in an electric circuit: 

ΔP = R ⋅ Q, where R = 8μL πr 4 (Poiseuille) (11) 

FFRangio method applied in this approach by solving a resistance network algebraically [43]. Though this approach is extremely fast ( < 1 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 ), but it neglects pulsatility and the spatial flow details are lost. 

Two -dimensional (2D) model: Two-dimensional approaches in coronary FFR applied in two distinct methodologies. Traditional 2D axisymmetric CFD models solve the Navier-Stokes equations in cylindrical coordinates (r, z) assuming rotational symmetry. The governing equations for incompressible case, the continuity equation is: 

𝜕𝜕 ur𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 + 𝜌𝜌 ur

𝜕𝜕  + 𝜕𝜕 uz𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 = 0 (12) and axial momentum:

where 𝑢𝑢 𝑛𝑛  and 𝑢𝑢 𝑧𝑧 denote radial and axial velocities.

FFR2D [44] methods applied for single -view cases, compute FFR from one angiographic projection in seconds, while dual-view methods (QFR, vFFR, FFRangio) use two orthogonal views for 3D reconstruction from 2D geometry. Unlike traditional 2D CFD, these methods apply empirical formulas to imagederived geometries rather than solving 2D momentum equations.

3. Methods for FFR Estimation 

Imaging-derived FFR methods can be organized into three methodological families that differ in how they trade off fidelity, speed, interpretability, and deployment robustness. Section 3.1 reviews physics-based approaches spanning full-order CFD to fast reduced-order formulations and highlights why boundary conditions and acquisition feasibility dominate real-world performance. Section 3.2 summarizes machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches, from physics-implicit surrogates to end-to-end models, and discusses reliability under dataset shift. Section 3.3 introduces physics-informed learning (PINNs and neural operators) as a bridging paradigm that aims to retain physical consistency while enabling rapid inference, though scalability and BC identifiability remain open challenges. 

3.1 CFD and Physics -Based Approaches 

3.1.1 Full -order CFD 

Full-order CFD computes coronary pressure and flow by solving the Navier–Stokes equations on a patient-specific coronary geometry reconstructed from imaging. In CT-based FFR, early multicenter evidence demonstrated the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of FFR derived from coronary CT angiography (FFR_CT) compared with invasive pressure-wire FFR [4-5], followed by the NXT trial which further validated performance in a broader cohort [4]. Beyond diagnostic accuracy, outcome and resource-impact studies suggested that CCTA + FFR_CT–guided strategies can improve care pathways and reduce unnecessary invasive testing in selected populations [5]. 

In practice, CT-derived CFD pipelines often adopt simplified but clinically pragmatic assumptions (e.g., steady/quasi-steady hyperemic simulation, Newtonian blood, rigid walls) and rely on prescribed inlet/outlet BCs (e.g., outlet resistances/Windkessel elements) to represent hyperemic microcirculation. As a result, geometry uncertainty and BC uncertainty can directly propagate into the predicted pressure drop and FFR. [8,15-16] 

Routine clinical scalability of full-order CFD is constrained by three recurring practical barriers: 

1. Geometry and reconstruction errors: Coronary CFD is sensitive to lumen geometry; segmentation uncertainty and CT artifacts can propagate to pressure-drop estimates. In real-world FFR_CT workflows, inadequate CT image quality can lead to analysis rejection, and motion-related degradation is a common contributor [7-8]. Calcium/stent blooming remains a well-recognized limitation for lumen delineation and stenosis characterization on cardiac CT [9-10]. 

2. Boundary -condition uncertainty and physiologic assumptions: Patient-specific inflow, outlet resistance allocation across branches, and the degree of hyperemia are rarely directly observed in routine imaging workflows; plausible BC choices can yield different pressure– flow solutions, especially in complex branching trees. This sensitivity is a primary driver of inter-study variability and motivates patient-specific surrogates and uncertainty-aware reporting (expanded in Section 3.1.3). 

3. Computational burden: Full-order CFD typically requires time-consuming meshing, solver iterations, and quality control, limiting turnaround time and broad deployment in routine care [3]. 

To reduce runtime while retaining explicit flow physics, two complementary directions are common. First, algorithmic acceleration keeps 3D CFD but dramatically reduces compute time; in angiography-derived workflows, a fast pseudotransient strategy reported vFFR computation in 189 s (~3.2 min) compared with >24 h for full-transient 3D CFD, representing a >450× reduction in computation time while maintaining clinically relevant agreement in its evaluation setting [37]. Second, physics-preserving model reduction decreases dimensionality to improve practicality: 1D mass–momentum equations obtained by cross-sectional averaging along the vessel centerline, often coupled to 0D elements for downstream microvascular beds [9]. Extensions include probabilistic 1D formulations to quantify uncertainty and tune model parameters (e.g., resistance/stenosis terms) using uncertainty quantification and Bayesian optimization [33]. 

These constraints motivate the broader class of fast-physics and reduced-order methods designed to fit workstation or cath-lab time budgets (Section 3.1.2). 

3.1.2 Fast physics and reduced -order formulations for imaging -derived FFR 

Reduced-order physics aims to preserve essential hemodynamics while avoiding full 3D transient CFD. In angiography-based workflows, a representative pattern is 3D-QCA reconstruction plus practical flow/velocity estimation, enabling minutes-scale computation and supporting “wire-free” physiology in the cath lab. Early angiography-derived CFD variants demonstrated feasibility from angiography alone [35], and subsequent pipelines combined 3D-QCA with contrast-flow surrogates (e.g., TIMI frame count) to enable more practical computation [36]. Further acceleration using paired steady-state or pseudotransient strategies reduces runtime while retaining explicit flow physics [37]. More recent hybrid strategies anchor CFD using invasive pressure measurements while using angiography-derived geometry, enabling estimation of intracoronary flow/resistance surrogates and evaluation against functional imaging such as SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging [46]. 

Another widely used reduced-order direction is 1D/0D physics, where cross-sectionally averaged equations (often coupled to lumped microvascular models) enable rapid whole-tree analysis while retaining governing-equation structure [9]. Such formulations are also conceptually aligned with several angiography-derived physiology techniques (e.g., QFR/vFFR families) that rely on simplified pressure–flow modeling to estimate lesion-level physiology under practical acquisition constraints. 

More recently, 2D fluid-mechanics approaches have been proposed to reduce reliance on full 3D reconstruction by operating more directly on 2D angiograms [44]. While promising for speed and workflow integration, such approaches still require careful external validation and clear characterization of when 2D assumptions hold. 

Practical feasibility and failure modes: Across fast-physics methods—especially those relying on 3D-QCA—real-world performance is often limited by angiographic acquisition quality and reconstruction feasibility. Common failure modes include: 

1. Foreshortening, vessel overlap, panning, and suboptimal contrast filling, which can prevent reliable reconstruction or degrade downstream estimation [13]. 

2. Insufficient projection separation / inadequate views, which limits 3D geometry recovery and flow estimation in multi-view pipelines [13-14]. 

3. Violation of physiologic assumptions (e.g., imperfect hyperemia equivalence or microvascular dysfunction), which can degrade diagnostic accuracy and motivates explicit quality control and appropriate case selection [13-14]. 3.1.3 Boundary conditions 

Across both full-order CFD and reduced-order physics, uncertainty in image-based FFR computation is often dominated by how BCs are specified. The most influential sources include: 

1. Inlet conditions, where inflow or inlet pressure is typically inferred from imaging-derived surrogates or population-based priors; 

2. Outlet conditions, particularly the allocation of distal resistance—and thus flow split— across a branching coronary tree; 

3. Hyperemia modeling, since the intended state of maximal vasodilation varies across patients and may be substantially attenuated in microvascular dysfunction. 

Together, these assumptions shape the pressure–flow relationship and can lead to meaningful shifts in predicted pressure drops and FFR values. Clinical guidance therefore emphasizes that FFR_CT interpretation should be integrated with anatomic CTA findings and broader clinical context, recognizing that modeling assumptions and patient-specific physiological conditions can influence the computed result [3]. 

For angiography-derived approaches, feasibility constraints—projection geometry, foreshortening, overlap, and contrast filling—interact with physiological assumptions and reconstruction/flow-estimation steps, amplifying error and non-computability in real-world settings. This reinforces the need for explicit quality control and, where available, incorporation of patient-specific physiological surrogates to reduce reliance on fixed priors and improve robustness across heterogeneous populations and acquisition conditions [13-14].

3.2 Machine Learning Approaches 

Machine-learning approaches complement physics-based FFR estimation by replacing part (or all) of the CFD pipeline with data-driven inference. The overarching promise is scalability—near-instant computation and easier deployment—while the main clinical requirement is reliability under heterogeneous scanners, protocols, image quality, and lesion morphologies. 

3.2.1 ML surrogates of CFD (physics -implicit) 

Physics-implicit surrogates learn a direct mapping from anatomy-derived representations (e.g., centerline geometry, lumen-area profiles, stenosis descriptors, vessel-tree/graph features, or MPR-derived profiles) to pressure drop or FFR using CFD outputs and/or invasive FFR supervision. Early “classical ML” CT-FFR studies established workstation-feasible inference and multi-center validation before modern end-to-end DL became mainstream. [28-29] In parallel, traditional supervised ML using quantitative angiographic descriptors provided early baselines for predicting FFR-defined ischemia in intermediate lesions. [30] 

Clinically oriented ML-based CT-FFR has been reported to outperform anatomy-only CCTA for identifying hemodynamically significant disease. [27] The field has increasingly emphasized on-site/workstation pipelines: a high-speed on-site DL-FFR-CT workflow reported AUC 0.975, ACC 95.9%, SEN 93.5%, SPE 97.7% (FFR-CT ≤ 0.80) with strong agreement with invasive FFR (r≈0.81). [47] A 2025 SMART trial summary similarly reported strong vessel -level discrimination 

(AUC ≈ 0.95) with high operating performance and near –real-time computation. [48] At the evidence-synthesis level, meta-analyses suggest ML-FFRCT and CFD-FFRCT have broadly comparable discrimination/specificity, but ML approaches may exhibit lower sensitivity in some aggregates, implying a practical trade-off between speed and potential missed ischemic lesions without careful calibration/external validation. [49-50] 

3.2.2 End to end deep learning 

DL models learn directly from CCTA volumes or artery-centered MPR stacks (3D CNN or CNN– attention hybrids) and may incorporate anatomy-aware vessel/tree representations to stabilize regression. In a multi-center evaluation, Hampe et al. reported AUC 0.78 (merged output) and AUC 0.83 (regression head) for predicting invasive FFR from CCTA, emphasizing feasibility but also sensitivity to protocol heterogeneity. [51] Beyond Transformers, lightweight attention blocks such as SE/CBAM are widely used to highlight lesion-relevant features and suppress artifact-dominated regions. [52-53] A 2025 onsite CCTA-FFR study using invasive iFR as reference reported AUC 0.79 with ACC 81.8% (SEN 89.3%, SPE 68.8%), illustrating that onsite practicality is improving while performance remains cohort- and endpoint-dependent. [54] In parallel, feature-based ML using quantitative plaque/CTA descriptors remains relevant as an interpretable alternative, linking imaging biomarkers to FFR-defined ischemia and impaired myocardial flow. [55] 

Angiography DL models range from single-frame predictors to video-based models that exploit contrast-flow dynamics, sometimes aiming for AI-only inference without explicit 3D reconstruction/CFD. Related work has shown that coronary flow velocity fields can be inferred from fluid-component concentration with high-performance neural networks, highlighting the value of contrast dynamics for field-level learning [56]. Temporal learning is commonly implemented via 3D CNNs or sequence models such as ConvLSTM/TCN. [57-58] A single-frame transfer-learning baseline reported AUC/ACC ~0.81 for FFR≤0.80 classification in intermediate 

LAD lesions. [59] Video-aware models can achieve substantially higher discrimination in their test settings: Mineo et al. reported AUC 0.95±0.03 (single-view, 3D) and 0.95±0.04 (multi-view, 3D) with ACC ~89% (SEN ~80%, SPE ~96–99%). [60] A multi-center evaluation of an AI-only angiography-derived FFR system reported AUC 0.93 with ACC 93.7%, while highlighting vulnerability to acquisition/domain shifts (frame rate, injection, vendor post-processing, projections/overlap). [61] Finally, physics-guided/tree-aware DL that predicts pressure/FFR fields from vessel-tree representations reflects a trend from single-index regression toward whole-tree functional mapping, potentially enabling richer physiological outputs than a single lesion-level number. [62] 

3.2.3 Uncertainty, calibration, and domain generalization 

Because ML-FFR informs high-stakes decisions (PCI vs deferral), point estimates should ideally be accompanied by calibrated confidence and/or uncertainty. Neural networks can be substantially miscalibrated; temperature scaling is a standard post-hoc method that can reduce miscalibration. [19] However, calibration and uncertainty quality often deteriorate under dataset shift; large-scale studies show that i.i.d. calibration does not guarantee calibration under corruptions or domain changes, and ensembles are often among the most robust approximations. [21] Uncertainty is commonly framed as epistemic vs aleatoric (e.g., Bayesian approximations or ensembles), supporting selective prediction and risk-aware decision support. [20] 

A practical pattern is uncertainty-guided triage: uncertain/borderline cases (poor image quality, heavy artifacts, atypical anatomy, protocol mismatch) are flagged for invasive FFR/iFR or expert review rather than forcing an automated decision. This concept has been demonstrated explicitly; for example, in the CT DL study above, “correcting” the top 20% most-uncertain cases to reference values improved performance to AUC 0.91, ACC 0.89, SEN 0.92, SPE 0.78 (vs all-artery AUC 0.78 / ACC 0.79). [51] More broadly, domain generalization provides a toolbox to improve out-of-distribution robustness across centers and protocols, motivating shift-aware validation (external sites, temporal splits), routine reporting of calibration (ECE/reliability curves), and conservative referral policies when confidence is low.

3.3 Emerging Direction: Physics -Informed Learning 

Physics-informed learning has emerged as a practical bridge between CFD and ML for imaging-derived FFR by embedding governing-equation structure (e.g., conservation laws and boundary consistency) into learning and inference. As discussed above, full-order CFD is physiologically grounded but often limited by meshing/solver burden and sensitivity to geometry and boundary-condition assumptions, whereas purely data-driven ML can be fast yet vulnerable to domain shift and non-physiological predictions when confronted with out-of-distribution anatomy or acquisition protocols. Physics-informed approaches aim to mitigate these complementary limitations by coupling learned representations with explicit physical constraints. The general PINN formulation for PDE-constrained learning is well established [23], with fluid-mechanics– focused guidance on training practices and failure modes [24]. Recent FFR-oriented studies increasingly report quantitative agreement with measured or reference FFR while aiming for fast inference and improved robustness across anatomy and acquisition conditions. 

3.3.1 Classic PINNs and challenges 

Classic PINNs (i.e., pointwise networks trained by minimizing PDE residuals plus boundary/initial-condition losses) have been directly applied to coronary hemodynamics as a surrogate to recover pressure/flow fields and derive FFR-related endpoints, typically by learning a continuous 3D pressure–velocity field in the coronary tree under Navier–Stokes constraints without explicit meshing/iterative CFD solving. Representative evidence includes a 3D PINN-based coronary-tree study reporting mean error versus invasive FFR of approximately 1.2%, 2.3%, and 2.8% on three evaluated arteries/cases [63]. These results support feasibility for patient-specific modeling when physics constraints are correctly enforced, and boundary conditions are well posed. 

Despite this promise, coronary FFR remains challenging for classic PINNs. Coronary geometries are complex (tortuosity, bifurcations, diffuse disease), and solutions can be highly sensitive to stenosis morphology and boundary conditions. Training can be stiff and unstable when enforcing PDE residuals and boundary constraints over irregular domains, with convergence and reproducibility varying across cases [24]. Methodological work in vascular hemodynamics suggests that optimization stability can be improved by training strategies such as progressively increasing boundary-condition complexity [31]. Meanwhile, boundary-condition identifiability remains a core bottleneck—multiple outlet-resistance/hyperemia configurations may yield physically plausible pressure fields, motivating stronger priors, auxiliary measurements, and uncertainty-aware validation before clinical deployment. 

3.3.2 Beyond classic PINNs: Neural operators and hybrid frameworks 

To improve scalability across heterogeneous anatomies and boundary conditions, neural operator learning (e.g., FNO) learns mappings between function spaces and can generalize across PDE families [25]. PINO further injects PDE residual constraints into operator learning to improve data efficiency and physical fidelity while preserving rapid inference [26]. In FFR-specific applications, recent work illustrates multiple “physics-informed hybrid” routes with measurable performance: 

Physics -informed graph learning: A conditional physics-informed graph neural network was evaluated on 183 real-world coronaries (143 X-ray, 40 CT angiography), reporting strong correlation between predicted and measured FFR (r = 0.89 on X-ray and r = 0.88 on CT) [64]. 

Physics -informed neural operator for angiography -derived FFR curves (BVPINO): In coronary angiographies from 215 vessels / 184 subjects, BVPINO was reported to achieve an “optimal balance” of effectiveness and efficiency, with high agreement/correlation between distal FFR predictions and invasive FFR. BVPINO achieves near real-time inference (< 1 s) while maintaining competitive diagnostic performance. For ischemia detection, it reports AUC = 0.960 and reaches ACC = 0.916 / F1 = 0.932 at the clinical thresh old (FFR ≤ 0.80); for disease -pattern identification, it reports AUC = 0.978 (diffuse) and 0.969 (focal) with ACC = 0.861 / F1 = 0.846 (PPG-based). Computation-based CFD and PINN baselines achieve slightly higher ACC/F1 but at much higher runtime (200 s for CFD; 480 s for PINN): ischemia (FFR) ACC/F1 = 0.921/0.939 (CFD) and 0.926/0.941 (PINN) vs 0.916/0.932 (BVPINO), and disease pattern (PPG) ACC/F1 = 0.867/0.850 (CFD) and 0.873/0.852 (PINN) vs 0.861/0.846 (BVPINO), highlighting a strong accuracy–efficiency trade-off for cath-lab deployment [65]. 

Physics -informed self -supervised digital -twin learning: PINS-CAD pretrains GNNs on 200,000 synthetic coronary digital twins with 1D Navier–Stokes/pressure-drop constraints and fine-tunes on 635 FAME2 patients, achieving AUC = 0.73 for predicting future cardiovascular events; it also generates spatially resolved pressure and FFR curves along centerlines [66]. 

Overall, these results suggest a consistent trend: physics-informed constraints can reach high correlation / competitive accuracy in selected datasets [64-65] while enabling fast inference and richer outputs (e.g., vessel-wise FFR curves) [65-66]. 

3.3.3 Outlook: likely roles in near -term clinical translation 

Near-term translation is most plausible via hybrid workflows: (i) using physics-informed losses/structures to regularize purely data-driven predictors; (ii) deploying physics-informed models as fast, constraint-aware surrogates for pressure/FFR mapping; and (iii) enabling risk-aware reporting (sensitivity or confidence flags) when boundary conditions are uncertain. The field is moving quickly, but broader external validation and clearer reporting of standardized endpoints (AUC/MAE/r, plus failure-case analyses) remain essential. 4. Evaluation and Clinical Translation 

This section shifts the focus from “how high is the average AUC/accuracy” (covered in Section 3) to questions that determine real-world adoption: (i) can the method be computed reliably in routine workflows, (ii) what are the dominant failure modes and how should QC gatekeeping be implemented, (iii) how do study design choices introduce bias, and (iv) how do complex lesion morphologies (e.g., bifurcation and diffuse disease) affect feasibility and clinical usefulness. 

4.1 Workflow integration, quality control, and failure modes 

In practice, the main bottleneck is often not model discrimination but workflow readiness: computational latency, user interaction burden, input quality requirements, and robust handling of failure. Here, quality control (QC) refers to explicit criteria used to decide whether an exam is analyzable/reportable (e.g., adequate image quality and acquisition requirements), and to trigger fallback strategies (repeat acquisition, alternative functional testing, or invasive pressure-wire FFR). 

CT -FFR: Common failure modes are closely linked to CCTA quality and segmentation/reconstruction robustness, including motion artifacts, noise/poor contrast timing, heavy calcification with blooming, and other cardiac CT artifacts that degrade lumen delineation [8-10]. In a large real-world analysis of technically unsuccessful CT-derived FFR, the FFRCT rejection rate due to inadequate image quality was 2.9% in the ADVANCE registry, but increased to 8.4% in a consecutive clinical cohort [6]. Motion artifacts were the dominant reason for failure in both cohorts (63/80, 78% in ADVANCE; 729/892, 64% in the clinical cohort) [6]. These data emphasize that computability/coverage and structured failure reporting should be treated as primary translation endpoints rather than secondary footnotes. 

Workflow speed is improving through algorithmic acceleration and learned surrogates. For example, a high-speed on-site deep learning–based FFR-CT workflow reported a mean analysis time of 7 minutes 54 seconds per patient, moving closer to clinical decision timelines [47]. However, faster inference does not eliminate the need for QC: low-quality inputs can still produce unreliable results or increase rejection rates, so deployment requires a clear gatekeeping policy and a safe fallback pathway. 

Angiography -derived physiology: Feasibility depends strongly on acquisition geometry and 3D-QCA/3D reconstruction quality. In a real-world “all-comers” QFR vs FFR study, QFR was attempted for all cases and was successful in 73% of patients, corresponding to 568/778 vessels [14]. Among 210 failed vessel-level attempts, the most frequent cause was the absence of two 

projections with ≥25° separation (43%), followed by excessive vessel overlap (31%), insufficient 

contrast filling (16%), and inadequate image quality (10%) [14]. Importantly, QFR measurement time and accuracy showed a clear learning curve: median measurement time was 271 s (IQR 206– 374), decreasing from 560 s (IQR 418–719) in the first 100 calculations to 226 s (IQR 168–251) in the last 100; in parallel, median absolute bias improved from 0.05 to 0.03 [14]. These results quantify the operator- and workflow-dependence of the technique and motivate standardized acquisition/QC protocols. 

More automated AI-based angio-FFR systems can further reduce per-case latency, but still require user interaction in a non-trivial fraction of cases. In one multi-center evaluation of an AI-based angiography-derived FFR approach, calculation time was 37.5 ± 7.4 s per angiographic video; the software automatically located the target lesion in 89% of cases, while 11% required manual lesion marking by the operator [61]. In a prospective multicenter study of an angiography-derived tool (AccuFFRangio), the total operating time was 4.20 ± 1.53 minutes, supporting feasibility within a catheter-lab workflow [67]. Overall, translation requires reporting not only accuracy but also end-to-end time, human-in-the-loop frequency, QC pass/fail rates, and structured failure modes with explicit fallback policies [14,61,67].

4.2 Study design and bias (selection bias, reference standards) 

Selection bias and “computability bias.” Many validation studies implicitly enrich for analyzable images by excluding cases with poor acquisition, heavy overlap, or insufficient projections. This inflates reported accuracy relative to real-world practice. A concrete illustration is the gap between controlled acquisition studies and all-comers practice: online QFR and invasive FFR were both obtained in 328/332 vessels (98.8%) in a prospective multicenter study [11], whereas real-world all-comers evidence shows substantially lower computability with angiographic acquisition– driven failures (see Section 5.1) [14]. Similarly, vFFR validation explicitly excluded a non-trivial fraction of enrolled patients for angiographic reasons (~14% in FAST II) [41], and CT-FFR feasibility also differs meaningfully between curated settings and routine consecutive cohorts due to image-quality limitations (see Section 5.1) [6]. For fair clinical translation, intention-to-diagnose reporting (including non-computable cases) is therefore essential. 

Reference standards and endpoint definition: Most studies use pressure-wire FFR (≤0.80) as 

the primary reference standard, but reference measurements themselves have procedural variability (e.g., hyperemia quality, pressure drift, wire position), which can blur the “ground truth” and should be standardized and reported [3]. Moreover, because different modalities estimate physiology under different assumptions (e.g., flow/velocity surrogates, microvascular modeling), subgroup analyses (acute vs chronic presentations; lesion length/diameter; gray-zone physiology) are important to avoid spectrum bias [67]. When possible, analyses should distinguish patient-level from vessel-level endpoints, and should clarify handling of multivessel disease and lesion selection rules. 

Bias controls that should be explicitly documented: Translation-focused studies should (i) pre-specify inclusion/exclusion and QC criteria, (ii) report the fraction and causes of non-computability, (iii) ensure blinded core-lab vs on-site comparisons where relevant, and (iv) provide sensitivity analyses that treat non-computable outputs as test failures rather than removing them post hoc [7,14,41]. 

4.3 Metrics and endpoints: from diagnostic accuracy to clinical utility 

Representative diagnostic benchmarks: Landmark CT-FFR trials reported strong discrimination beyond anatomy-only CCTA, with per-vessel AUC around 0.90 and accuracy in the low-to-mid 80% range in early validation (e.g., DISCOVER-FLOW) [1], while DeFACTO reported per-patient AUC of 0.81 with high sensitivity (90%) but modest specificity (54%), highlighting the practical importance of false positives [2]. Subsequent prospective multicenter validation (e.g., NXT) improved overall diagnostic performance (per-patient AUC ~0.90; accuracy ~81%) under more standardized protocols [4]. For angiography-derived methods, online QFR achieved vessel-level diagnostic accuracy of 92.7% (304/328) [11], vFFR reported diagnostic accuracy of 90% (sensitivity 81%, specificity 95%) in FAST II [41], and on-site AccuFFRangio achieved accuracy of 95.07% with AUC 0.972 in a prospective multicenter study [67]. These multi-modality numbers serve as useful anchors, but translation requires more than AUC. 

Agreement, reproducibility, and “beyond-threshold” endpoints. Many clinical decisions depend on how close estimates are to the wire-based reference, especially in gray-zone physiology. In real-world QFR–FFR comparisons, the median absolute difference was 0.03, and 7% of cases differed by >0.10 (QFR vs FFR), which can meaningfully change downstream treatment decisions [14]. In ACCURATE, AccuFFRangio showed mean difference 0.01 ± 0.06 versus FFR and high discrimination (AUC 0.972) [67]. Reproducibility is also a deployment requirement: an on-site DL-FFR-CT workflow reported interobserver ICC of 0.94 and intraobserver ICC of 0.85, suggesting that the end-to-end pipeline can be consistent when executed under standardized conditions [47]. For diffuse or serial disease, pullback-shape agreement (not only distal-point classification) becomes particularly relevant, because a single distal value may not capture distributed pressure loss. 

Clinical impact endpoints: Translation should ultimately show patient-management benefit rather than only diagnostic performance. In PLATFORM, an FFR-CT–guided strategy reduced unnecessary invasive angiography in the “planned invasive” cohort; among those who proceeded to angiography, the proportion without obstructive CAD was 12% versus 73% in usual care, consistent with improved gatekeeping [5]. For angiography-based physiology, FAVOR III China reported improved 1-year clinical outcomes with QFR-guided lesion selection (MACE 5.8% vs 8.8%; hazard ratio 0.65) [12]. These outcome-oriented endpoints provide higher-level evidence that physiology-informed strategies can change care pathways, provided feasibility and QC are addressed. 

4.4 Lesion location and morphology: bifurcation and diffuse disease 

Lesion morphology and location can strongly affect both feasibility and clinical usefulness, and should be treated as explicit stratification variables in translation studies. 

Bifurcation, overlap, and complex geometry: Angiography-derived methods are sensitive to projection requirements and overlap, which are often more challenging in bifurcation and tortuous anatomy. Real-world all-comers evidence indicates that overlap/foreshortening and inadequate projection separation are major drivers of non-computability (see Section 5.1), consistent with practical QFR requirements and head-to-head studies of performance determinants [13-14]. For deployment, bifurcation-specific QC checks (overlap, projection separation) should be explicit, with standardized guidance for re-acquisition when QC fails. 

Diffuse disease and serial lesions: Diffuse atherosclerosis produces distributed pressure loss 

without a single focal stenosis, making a binary “FFR ≤0.80 at one point” an incomplete descriptor 

of physiology. FAST II explicitly defined diffuse disease as wall irregularities without focal lesions with intermediate diameter stenosis (30–70%), underscoring that physiologic assessment often extends beyond discrete stenosis grading [41]. For such morphologies, pullback-style endpoints (shape and total pressure-loss distribution) and robustness to microvascular assumptions become more important than point estimates alone. 

Severe calcification and CT blooming: For CT-FFR, heavy calcification and blooming artifacts can degrade lumen assessment and increase technical failure or bias; artifact mechanisms and mitigation strategies are well described in cardiac CT literature [9-10]. Real-world experience indicates that challenging morphologies frequently coexist with challenging acquisition conditions and higher failure risk (see Section 5.1), reinforcing the need for QC gatekeeping and robust fallback strategies [6]. 

Overall, translation studies should move beyond pooled performance and explicitly report feasibility, failure modes, and decision-impact metrics across lesion morphologies (bifurcation vs non-bifurcation; focal vs diffuse; calcified vs non-calcified), because these strata often determine where imaging-derived physiology provides the greatest clinical value—and where it is most likely to fail without rigorous QC [7,9-10,13-14]. 

5. Conclusion 

Imaging-derived FFR research is moving from optimizing AUC alone toward translation-driven goals: clinical time budgets, scalability, and robustness across centers. Between full-order CFD (mechanistically grounded but slow and workflow-heavy) and purely data-driven learning (fast but potentially non-physiological under domain shift), physics-informed learning, especially PINNs and neural operators (FNO/PINO), is emerging as a practical bridge. It aims to preserve key physical structure while enabling near real-time inference and richer outputs, such as centerline pressure/FFR curves. [23-26,31,65-66] 

Classic PINNs learn pressure–velocity fields by minimizing PDE residuals pointwise, but training can be unstable in complex coronary trees and sensitive to how boundary conditions are posed. [24,63] In contrast, neural operators better match clinical-scale deployment by learning function-to-function mappings that can generalize across geometries and boundary configurations. PINO further injects PDE residual constraints into operator learning, improving physical fidelity without sacrificing speed. [25-26] Importantly, operator-based frameworks naturally support curve-level physiology, not only a single distal value—an advantage for diffuse or serial disease where pullback-like shape and distributed pressure loss are clinically meaningful. [65-66] Recent FFR-oriented evidence also suggests that PINO-style models can achieve near real-time inference with competitive agreement and ischemia-detection performance, offering a compelling accuracy– efficiency trade-off for cath-lab workflows. [65] 

From a clinical translation and evaluation perspective, these methodological advantages only matter if studies answer workflow questions in real practice: Can the method be computed reliably? How long does it take end-to-end? How much human interaction is required? What happens when computation fails? Accordingly, beyond AUC/accuracy, translation-focused evaluations should routinely report, under an intention-to-diagnose framework, coverage/non-computability rates and dominant causes (CT: motion and calcium/blooming artifacts; ICA: inadequate view separation, overlap/foreshortening, and insufficient contrast filling) [7-10,13-14], as well as end-to-end operating time, learning curves, and stratified performance in complex morphologies (bifurcation, diffuse/serial disease). [14,41] For PINNs/PINOs that output curves or fields, assessment should 

extend beyond pointwise FFR≤0.80 classification to include curve/shape agreement and decision -impact–relevant endpoints, to validate that they deliver interpretable, actionable physiology within cath-lab time constraints. [65-66] 

Looking ahead, the priority is deployable system capability: stable training on branching geometries, systematic external validation across acquisition variability, and clinically aligned evaluation and reporting. In the near term, hybrid pipelines that combine physics-informed operators with reduced-order physics and vessel-tree representations are likely to be the most practical path to adoption.
