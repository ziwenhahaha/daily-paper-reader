(Dated: February 20, 2026) Friction losses in rough pipes are commonly predicted with semi-empirical correlations such as the Colebrook–White equation [C. F. Colebrook, J. Inst. Civ. Eng. 11, 133 (1939)] and explicit approximations (e.g. Haaland) [S. E. Haaland, J. Fluids Eng. 105, 89 (1983)], which interpolate decades of data but do not fully reproduce the behaviour of Nikuradse’s rough pipe experiments [J. Nikuradse, NACA Tech. Memo. 1292 (1950)]. Here, we derive scaling relations for the viscous and turbulent contributions to the streamwise pressure drop using an order-of-magnitude analysis (OMA) of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations and the mean/turbulent kinetic-energy transport. These relations yield four quantitative physical constraints that bound the local sensitivi-ties of ∆ P to mean velocity, roughness, viscosity and density through exponent envelopes, and serve as a physics prior for symbolic regression. Using the combined data of Nikuradse and smooth-pipe measurements [M. V. Zagarola and A. J. Smits, Phys. Rev. Lett. 80, 239 (1998)], we seek compact and explicit correlations for f = g(Re , ε/D ) that fit the experiments while respecting the OMA constraints and recovering correct smooth and fully rough asymptotics rather than simply tuning another empirical interpolation between smooth-wall and fully rough limits. We modify a multigene genetic-programming engine (GPTIPS2) to jointly optimize tree structure, linear gene weights and embedded constants, and evaluate each model by three minimization objectives: fitness, structural complexity and a physics score measuring constraint violation; a three-dimensional Pareto front is evolved rather than a single regularized loss. The method discovers short, interpretable expressions that satisfy the constraints while accurately reproducing friction factors across smooth-to-rough and over a wide Reynolds number range. The best fitting correlation is validated on rough, high-Re 

campaigns [C. J. Swanson et al. , J. Fluid Mech. 461, 51 (2002); M. A. Shockling et al. , J. Fluid Mech. 564, 267 (2006); L. I. Langelandsvik et al. , J. Fluid Mech. 595, 323 (2008)] up to Re ∼ 10 7.The framework generalizes to other nondimensional correlation problems where only leading-order balances are known. 

I. INTRODUCTION 

Predictive correlations for frictional pressure loss in pipe flows are central to hydraulic design, flow meter-ing, and energy systems. Classical treatments express the Darcy–Weisbach friction factor f as a function of the Reynolds number Re and the relative roughness ε/D , and summarize decades of experiments in compact formulas such as the Colebrook–White equation and its explicit approximations such as Haaland equation, together with the Moody diagram that engineers use in practice [1– 4]. The underlying structure is inherently dimensionless: once the flow is fully developed, the pressure gradient can depend only on the ratios of inertial to viscous forces and on the relative wall-roughness. Dimensional analysis provides a natural starting point for such problems. Buckingham-Π theorem guarantees

that any physically admissible relation among ∆ P , U m,

ρ, μ, D, L, and ε may be written in terms of a reduced set of dimensionless groups [5, 6]. For internal flows, this leads to the familiar choice of the Reynolds number and the relative roughness, so that f = f (Re, ε/D ). However, the theorem is silent on which dimensionless groups are most predictive and on how they should be combined. Historically, this ranking has been supplied by physi-cal reasoning and experiments: Blasius used smooth-pipe data to infer a nearly power-law dependence of the fric-tion factor on Re [7], while Nikuradse’s sand-grain rough-ness experiments mapped out the dependence on ε/D 

and extended the data into the fully rough regime [8]. At the same time, it has long been recognized that roughness morphology matters: compared with Nikuradse’s uni-form sand grains, commercial pipes with broader distri-butions of protuberance sizes can exhibit a more gradual departure from the smooth-pipe law. In that setting, ε is most consistently interpreted as an effective (equivalent sand-grain) roughness referenced to Nikuradse-style be-haviour, enabling different surface types to be compared

2on a common roughness scale [9]. In a similar spirit, ear-lier resistance formulations in hydraulics also emphasized relative roughness measures and reported weak power de-pendence of roughness coefficients on an absolute rough-ness scale [10]. Semi-empirical correlations such as Cole-brook–White interpolate between these regimes but re-main implicit and non-trivial to invert. Recent years have seen growing interest in using data-driven methods to discover dimensionless groups and closure relations directly from experimental or numer-ical data. The ”Virtual Nikuradse” model, for exam-ple, constructs a high-fidelity friction-factor surface from Nikuradse-style data via spline and polynomial fits [11]. More broadly, symbolic regression and related techniques seek analytical expressions that reproduce observed data while remaining compact and interpretable [12–15]. The GPTIPS 2 framework, in particular, provides a multi-gene genetic-programming implementation for symbolic regression in MATLAB [16], and tools such as PySR offer efficient modern solvers in Python/Julia [15]. Yet most of these applications only enforce dimensional homogeneity and perhaps simple bounds or penalties; they typically do not encode the detailed asymptotics and monotonicity properties that are known for pipe friction. As a result, purely data-driven symbolic models may match friction-factor data over the training range but exhibit unphysical behaviour when extrapolated: exponents in ∆ P versus velocity may drift outside plausible ranges, pressure drop may decrease with increasing roughness in some corner of parameter space, or the dependence on viscosity and density may contradict basic momentum-balance consid-erations. For engineering use, such pathologies are unac-ceptable even if they occur in regions with sparse data. In this work, we combine a problem-specific order-of-magnitude analysis (OMA) with physics-constrained symbolic regression to discover new correlations for the friction factor in turbulent pipe flows. Starting from a stream-wise momentum balance and energy equations in the framework of Reynolds decomposition and averag-ing, we derive an OMA model for the pressure drop that has separate viscous and roughness-dominated turbulent contributions. The two contributions are blended with a logistic function so that the resulting equation can reflect the transition from viscous effects-dominated smooth tur-bulent pipe flow to inertial turbulence-dominated rough turbulent pipe flow. Written in dimensionless form, this OMA model implies specific, testable trends for how the pressure drop behaves when one physical parameter is varied while the others are held fixed. We characterize these trends through four logarithmic sensitivities: (i) the effective velocity exponent, (ii) the roughness sensi-tivity, (iii) the viscous sensitivity, and (iv) the density sensitivity. Evaluated over the Nikuradse and Superpipe parameter ranges, the OMA model yields tight envelopes for these quantities. We then embed these constraints in a modified symbolic-regression pipeline built on GPTIPS 2. The input space consists of a grid of candidate dimensionless groups generated by Buckingham-Π analysis; individu-als are multi-gene expressions that linearly combine sym-bolic subtrees of these groups. For each candidate model, we first refit all linear gene weights and embedded con-stants by a two-stage procedure: ridge-regularized least squares followed by joint optimization of all constants via Nelder–Mead, using a fast evaluation of the OMA-inspired physics score. The final model is evaluated on three objectives: (i) fitness (normalised RMSE of f ), (ii) a structural complexity measure, and (iii) a physics score that summarizes the worst violation of the OMA con-straints. Multi-objective selection with Pareto sorting and crowding distance is applied directly to these three objective scores rather than folding physics into a single penalty term, so that accuracy, simplicity, and physical consistency can be traded explicitly. The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we derive an OMA model for pressure drop in rough turbu-lent pipes that yields quantitative, data-calibrated con-straints on the local power-law exponents with respect to velocity, roughness, viscosity, and density. Second, we design a physics-informed symbolic-regression work-flow that augments GPTIPS 2 with joint constant opti-mization and a three-objective Pareto search driven by these OMA constraints. Third, applying this framework to Nikuradse and Superpipe datasets, we obtain a com-pact explicit correlations for ∆ P and f (Re, ε/D ) that match or exceed the accuracy of classical formulas while remaining consistent with the asymptotic behaviour im-plied by the OMA analysis.   

> II. METHODOLOGY A. Derivation of Governing Equations

The symbolic regression process is, in principle, an op-timization process, and the constraints of this process are derived from the order-of-magnitude analysis. The Reynolds transport equations, along with Reynolds de-composition and averaging, provide a suitable framework for turbulent flows. Without delving into the complex-ity of cylindrical coordinates, the analysis is conducted for an incompressible, fully developed horizontal channel flow. A control volume (CV) shown in Fig. 1a is selected from the fully developed portion of the channel having a height of h, and a width of w. The channel portion has a length of L and a width much longer than its height (w >> h ), so the flow is assumed to be two-dimensional. Hence, the momentum equation for this control volume can be written as: ΣFi = ∂∂t

The second term on the right-hand side (RHS) is the net flow rate of momentum, whereas the first term on the RHS is the rate of change of momentum in CV. In addition, the surface integral can be transformed into a volume integral by the divergence theorem: ΣFi = ∂∂t

(4) The momentum equation along the x1 direction, with the effective forces and with the simplifications related to the flow of interest, namely being fully developed, statisti-cally stationary, incompressible, and two-dimensional, is as follows:

is the viscous shear stress on the lower wall. Using the differential RANS equation, it can be shown that u1u2 is negative at half the channel height, zero at the wall, and zero at the channel center. Due to the antisymmetry of the Reynolds stress profile about the channel center, the volume integral of the gradient of 

u1u2 is zero. Hence, knowing that the pressure gradient is constant in the flow direction, the pressure drop along the CV with length L reads: ∆P = 2 Lh μ ∂U 1

(6) This equation clearly shows that the drop in pressure potential in the flow direction is used to overcome the viscous stresses on the walls. Nevertheless, the effect of turbulence is hidden in the velocity gradient of the mean longitudinal velocity. The impact of turbulence can be explicitly seen in the transport equation for the mechanical energy, which is

The overline symbol represents the ensemble averaging. Introducing decomposed variables into Eq. 8 and apply-ing Reynolds Averaging, the ensemble mean of the kinetic energy equation reads:

(10) 4Note that 1 /2 Ui Ui and 1 /2 uiui are the kinetic energy per unit mass of the mean flow and the turbulent flow, respectively. This equation can be split into a mean and a turbulent component. The transport equation for the mechanical energy of the mean flow is:

(11) The second term on the left-hand side (LHS) is the ex-tracted energy from the mean by turbulence, and the last term is the dissipation rate of the mean mechanical energy. The transport equation for the turbulent me-chanical energy is:

(12) The second and third terms at the LHS are the produc-tion of turbulence kinetic energy and the work done by the Reynolds stresses due to turbulent fluctuations, re-spectively. The transport equation of mean mechanical energy (8) for the two-dimensional horizontal fully developed incom-pressible statistically stationary turbulent channel flow simplifies to:

(13) Further simplification can be done when the volume in-tegral of both sides of this equation for the CV in Fig.1 is done. In this integral form, some of the volume integrals can be converted to surface integrals using the divergence theorem. The result of this integration is as follows:

(17) The LHS of the above equation represents the sum of turbulence kinetic energy production and the extracted kinetic energy from the mean flow to turbulence. Thus, this sum can be converted to a surface integral, which is also zero owing to fully developed two-dimensional flow:

Hence, Eq. 17 reduces to the balance between the work done by the pressure and the viscous dissipation rate calculated from mean velocity gradients and the gradients of veloc-ity fluctuations, respectively.

(21) The last term represents the total dissipation rate of tur-bulence kinetic energy in the CV, and no further sim-plification can be done for it. When Eq. 21 is carefully 5examined, one can end up with the conclusion that the pressure gradient is solely dependent on viscous effects, which is opposite to the observations that the coefficients of pressure drop or drag become independent of viscous effects at high Reynolds numbers [1, 8, 17]. This is a paradox that cannot be explained by Eqn. 21. However, the transport equation of turbulent kinetic energy (12) can resolve it. The integral of this equation for the flow considered here simplifies to

Moreover, the causal re-lationship established in the transport equation asserts that the production rate of turbulence kinetic energy di-rectly dictates its dissipation rate. Hence, the turbulence dissipation rate in Eq. 21 can be replaced by the turbu-lence kinetic energy production as follows:

(24) where ˙Q is the volume flow rate. The resulting relation clearly decomposes viscous and inertial turbulent effects. It reflects how the work done by the pressure gradient is channelled into viscous dissipation and turbulence pro-duction rates. This work is transformed irreversibly into internal energy. Furthermore, the viscous and inertial ef-fects contributing to the wall shear stress become visible when ∂P /∂x 1 is left alone in this equation and equated to the one obtained from the momentum equation (6) as follows:

> B. Order of Magnitude Analysis (OMA)

The equations 6 and 26 can be used to infer the pres-sure drop’s scaling with respect to the other parameters. The former states that the wall shear stress determines the pressure gradient, whereas the latter states that the pressure drop arises due to viscous dissipation of the mean velocity and the production of turbulent kinetic energy. As the pressure drop equation derived from the en-ergy equation (Eq. 26) explicitly captures the effect of turbulence, it will be used for OMA. At this point, sev-eral physically reasonable assumptions have to be made on the representative values of the unknown terms in Eq. 26. The gradients in x1 and x2 directions scale with 1/L and 1 /h , respectively. U 1 scales with the ensem-ble and surface average mean velocity U m, and the u1u2

scales with the negative of the surface average turbulent kinetic energy, which is km = 0 .5( uiui). Hence, the order of magnitudes of each term can be written as follows: ∆Pvisc ≈ μU mwh

(38) 

f ≈ 0.316 Re −1/4 (39) Although this ∆ P model lacks separate terms for the vis-cous and turbulent inertial terms, in principle, the power exponent of 7 /4 for U m is expected since one can approx-imate a second-order polynomial, like the one in Eq. 35, by a power function having an exponent between 1 and 2. The functional forms for the pressure drop and the friction factor (Eqs. 35 and 36) are derived by OMA, but they might not truly represent the exact behaviour. For example, the turbulent part takes a constant value at all Reynolds numbers. However, f becomes Reynolds-number-independent only at large Reynolds numbers. In connection with that, the functional form of f (Eq. 36) is not capable of reproducing the minima for rough pipes, which happens as f transits from the smooth pipe regime to the rough pipe regime. This transition is also Reynolds-number-dependent. It is important to note that taking the velocity gra-dient directly proportional to U m/h as shown in Eq. 29 is an assumption. On the contrary, the U m and μ in Eq. 27, as well as ρ in Eq. 28 are not assumed, i.e., they are part of the derived governing equation. Hence, the power exponents of U m in Eq. 35 can be relaxed, only if the dimensional homogeneity requirement for ∆ P model holds. The simplest way to guarantee the dimensional ho-mogeneity is to make a symbolic regression to f (Re, ε/D )instead of ∆ P (U m, ρ, μ, L, D, ε ). To have a transition from the smooth pipe regime to a rough pipe regime, the terms in the f equation (36) should be relaxed to reflect the Reynolds number and relative roughness dependen-cies of this transition. Allowing a transition behavior is legitimate because the assumption that dissipation is de-termined by production (Eq. 22) is expected to hold for rough pipe flows at high Reynolds numbers. The logis-tic function has previously been used and can reflect the transition [11]. One form of the logistic function is: 

g(t) = glower + gupper − glower 

1 + e−β(t−t0) (40) where t is the independent variable, β is the slope and 

t0 is the midpoint of transition. Letting g be f , t be Re ,and the upper and lower values to be fturb and fvisc of Eqs. 34 and 33, respectively, a more general form of the friction factor can be obtained as follows: 

f ≈fvisc + fturb − fvisc 

1 + e−β(Re −Re tr )

=fvisc 

e−β(Re −Re tr )

1 + e−β(Re −Re tr ) + fturb 

11 + e−β(Re −Re tr )

(41) 

Re tr (ε/D ) is the midpoint of transition and β(ε/D ) is the slope of the transition. These parameters are func-tions of relative roughness, and β(ε/D ) is expected to rise with increasing ε/D , whereas Re tr (ε/D ) is expected to decrease. For the curve fitting, Re tr (ε/D ) = Q/ (ε/D )r

and β = S(ε/D )p can be used with the coefficients Q, r,

S, and p. After relaxing the exponent of Re from one to 

η, the functional form of the friction factor equation can be written as: 

f ≈ 2Avisc

The constants of the curve fit are given in Table I. The fit in Fig. 2 is very accurate up to Re = 10 6, but it can not catch the high Reynolds number behavior of the smooth pipe as Colebrook’s relation.

> C. Constraints for Regression

Despite their complexity and the extensive number of unknown parameters in Eqs. 41 and 43, it is better to use these equations to guide symbolic regression alongside the experimental data. To bias the search toward phys-ically admissible regressions for f , we incorporate four constraints ( C1-C4), which are implemented in the re-gression process by using lightweight and model-only di-agnostics to verify their fulfilment. These diagnostics are evaluated on synthetic grids of the independent variables. Using the friction factor regression models, the pressure drop is calculated over the synthetic grid, and the con-straints are checked for fulfilment. The constraints are derived as follows: 

FIG. 3: Exponent of surface average mean velocity of OMA-based model and Haaland’s model.  

> 1. Constraint C 1: Velocity Sensitivity Exponent

According to Eqs. 42 and 43, the dependence of ∆ P

on the mean speed U m at fixed ρ, μ, ε, D , and L is a lin-ear–plus–quadratic superposition. At sufficiently small 

U m the viscous term dominates and ∆ P ∝ U m; at sufficiently large U m the turbulent term dominates and ∆P ∝ U 2

> m

. We cannot control the exact shape of the SR model during regression, but locally, it can be approxi-mated by a power law ∆Pmodel ≈ R U χm. (44) A local logarithmic velocity exponent χ is then defined as 

χ = ∂ log ∆ Pmodel 

∂ log U m

= U m

∆Pmodel

∂U m

. (45) Evaluating χ for the OMA model over the Nikuradse data range shows that it smoothly interpolates between 

χ ≈ 1 in the viscous limit and values slightly above χ =2 in the smooth–rough transition, before relaxing back toward χ = 2 in the fully rough regime. In particular, the OMA model remains within 1 ≲ χ ≲ χmax with 

χmax ≃ 2.4. We therefore use the following properties as constraint C1:∆Pmodel is non-decreasing in U m, (46a) 1 ≲ χ ≲ χmax , (46b) lim  

> Um→∞

χ = 2 . (46c) Here χmax is taken directly from the OMA prediction; it is used as a soft upper bound during regression rather than a hard universal limit.  

> 2. Constraint C 2: Sensitivity to Roughness at Fixed Reynolds Number

In the OMA model (Eq. 42), wall roughness enters only through increasing factors of the form ( ε/D )k and 8

FIG. 4: Exponent of roughness of OMA-based model and Haaland’s model. (ε/D )n with k, n ≥ 0. At fixed U m, ρ, μ, D, L this im-plies that the pressure drop must not systematically de-crease when the pipe is made rougher: Once the flow is in the hydraulically rough regime, additional roughness can only increase the resistance. We quantify the roughness sensitivity through the logarithmic exponent: 

s = ∂ log ∆ P∂ log ε = ε

∆P∂∆P∂ε . (47) When evaluated on the OMA model over Nikuradse-like conditions, s is non–negative and remains below a modest upper bound smax ≈ 0.4. This motivates the following testable properties at fixed Reynolds number: 

∂∆P∂ε ≥ 0, (48a) 0 ≤ s = ∂ log ∆ P∂ log ε ≲ smax ≈ 0.4. (48b) Small, localized negative values of s near the hydrauli-cally smooth limit are interpreted as numerical artifacts of the finite-difference evaluation and are tolerated to a limited extent. The precise aggregation of violations into a scalar C2 score is described in the constraint–scoring section.  

> 3. Constraint C 3: Viscous Consistency at Fixed Velocity

At fixed U m, ρ, D, L the OMA model contains a vis-cous contribution that is linear in μ and a turbulent con-tribution that does not depend explicitly on μ. In the hydraulically smooth regime, this yields a small positive logarithmic exponent, whereas in the fully rough regime, the pressure drop becomes effectively independent of μ.We measure this with: 

α = ∂ log ∆ P∂ log μ = μ

∆P∂∆P∂μ . (49) For the OMA model, α lies in a narrow positive range 0 ≲ α ≲ 0.3 and approaches α → 0 as ε/D → ∞ . The 

FIG. 5: Exponent of viscosity of OMA-based model and Haaland’s model. SR equation preserves the same qualitative trend, but can show mildly negative α for very rough pipes and low Reynolds numbers, where the explicit roughness depen-dence dominates and increasing μ shifts the operating point along a nearly flat portion of the rough plateau. Guided by the OMA envelope, we therefore adopt: 

αmin ≤ α ≤ αmax , (50a) lim  

> Re →∞

α = 0 , (50b) with αmin ≈ − 0.5 and αmax ≈ 1. These values are wide enough to contain the SR model wherever it matches the OMA behaviour, while excluding unphysical strong decreases or increases of ∆ P with viscosity.  

> 4. Constraint C 4: Density Sensitivity at Fixed Velocity

In the OMA model, at fixed U m, μ, D, L the turbulent contribution is linear in ρ whereas the viscous term is in-dependent of ρ. Neglecting the weak density–dependence of the friction factor, this suggests a logarithmic exponent of order unity: 

γ = ∂ log ∆ P∂ log ρ = ρ

∆P∂∆P∂ρ . (51) When evaluated on the OMA model over the turbu-lent range, γ stays close to one, typically 0 .7 ≲ γ ≲ 1, and approaches γ → 1 as the flow becomes fully rough. The SR correlation reproduces this structure but, in the smooth–rough transition, the implicit ρ-dependence through Re can reinforce the explicit ρ factor and yield exponents up to γ ≈ 1.3. Using OMA as the physical reference, we thus relax the upper bound while enforcing positivity of ∂∆P/∂ρ :0 ≤ γ ≤ γmax , (52a) 

∂∆P∂ρ ≥ 0, (52b) 9

> D. Symbolic Regression with Constraints

We implement symbolic regression by modifying the multi-gene genetic programming framework of GPTIPS 2.0 [16]. The most obvious modifications are the con-version from 2-D to 3-D optimization and the new joint coefficient optimization method. Each individual model is a linear combination of G expression trees (genes): 

f (Re , ε/D ) = 

> G

X

> g=1

wg Tg

 Re , ε/D ; θg

,

where each gene Tg is built from a primitive set 

{+, −, ×, /, (·)m, log , exp , tanh }, terminal nodes are di-mensionless inputs from the Buckingham–Π grid, and θg

collects ephemeral (numeric) constants inside the trees. 

Population initialization. The initial population is generated by ramped half–and–half with prescribed depth and node limits. Domain–safe primitives (pro-tected division, safe logarithms, etc.) are used so that every expression can be evaluated on the entire training grid (Re , ε/D ) without producing non–finite values. 

Joint optimization of weights and constants. For each individual, all numeric quantities that can be tuned are collected into a single parameter vector 

par =  w1, . . . , w G, θ 1, . . . , θ G

.

Optimization proceeds in two stages. First, with con-stants θg fixed at their current values, all genes are eval-uated on the training set to form a design matrix G whose columns contain the gene outputs. A ridge regression on 

G provides an initial estimate of the weights wg ; any non-finite columns are zeroed so that pathological genes are automatically assigned zero weight. Second, the warm-started weights are concatenated with the current con-stants to form an initial vector par 0, and a Nelder–Mead search is applied to minimize the prediction error of ∆ P

on the training data. Unlike standard GPTIPS 2, this step jointly refines both linear coefficients and non-linear constants, which helps prevent extremely nested func-tions while improving asymptotic behaviour and agree-ment with Nikuradse trends. 

Three objective components. In our modified ver-sion of GPTIPS 2.0, using the optimized parameter vec-tor par ⋆, each individual is evaluated in terms of three minimization objectives: 

• Fitness Jerr : root–mean–squared error (RMSE) of the predicted ∆ P on the training set. 

• Complexity Jcomp : the total number of nodes (op-erators, variables, and constants) in the final sym-bolic expression. Since our models are multi-gene, we compute Jcomp by summing the node counts of all gene trees. In this paper, this value is reported simply as “nodes”. 

• Physics objective Jphys : we compute the four constraint scores C1–C4 from the or-der–of–magnitude analysis (velocity exponent, roughness monotonicity, viscous consistency, den-sity sensitivity). Each Ck ∈ [0 , 1] measures vio-lation of the corresponding OMA trend, and we aggregate them as 

Jphys = max {C1, C 2, C 3, C 4},

so that a model is only considered strongly physics–consistent if it behaves correctly in all four directions. This yields a three–dimensional objective vector 

J =  Jfit , J comp , J phys

2D ,

Constraint scores are computed from logarithmic deriva-tives estimated using finite-difference or gradient opera-tors on log-spaced grids; any non-finite or non-positive model output encountered during a sweep is treated as a hard failure and yields the maximal penalty for that sweep. Score C1 enforces velocity-scaling consistency. For each tested ε/D , we sweep Re ∈ [10 4, 10 9] on a log grid (160 points), map to U m = Re μ ref /(ρD ), and estimate 

χ = ∂ log ∆ Pmodel 

∂ log U m10 using gradient applied to log ∆ P versus log U m (af-ter a light three-point moving-average smoothing). We apply a two-zone envelope: in the transitional range 10 4 ≤ Re ≤ 10 6 we require 1 .0 ≤ χ ≤ 2.4, while in the fully rough tail 10 6 ≤ Re ≤ 10 9 we enforce χ ≈ 2 within tolerance tolB = 0 .01. The two penalties are combined as 0 .3 penA + 0 .7 penB per roughness level, and C1 is taken as the worst case over ε/D .Score C2 enforces roughness monotonicity. At 12 Reynolds-number slices Re ∈ [3 × 10 3, 10 8], we sweep the physical roughness ε on a log grid (360 points) spanning: 

ε ∈ [0 .5 ( ε/D )min D, 1.5 ( ε/D )max D] and compute 

s = ∂ log ∆ Pmodel 

∂ log ε

using gradient . We tolerate small negative slopes via 

s ≥ − sallow with sallow = 0 .1, and define C2 by combining the fraction of violating grid points across ε and then averaging across Reynolds slices. Score C3 enforces viscosity consistency. At fixed 

ε/D = 10 −3 we sweep μ ∈ [10 −4, 10 −1] (120 log-spaced points) while keeping U m = 2 m /s by setting Re =

ρU mD/μ . We then compute ∆ Pmodel (μ) and set C3 to the fraction of points where ∆ P decreases with increasing 

μ (zero tolerance in the current implementation). 

α = ∂ log ∆ Pmodel 

∂ log μ

Score C4 enforces density consistency. At fixed ε/D =10 −3 and U m = 2 m /s we sweep ρ ∈ [10 2, 10 4] (20 log-spaced points) and estimate 

γ = ∂ log ∆ Pmodel 

∂ log ρ .

We take C4 = ⟨| γ − 1|⟩ , with invalid evaluations assigned 

C4 = 1. The overall physics objective is reported as 

Jphys = max( C1, C 2, C 3, C 4). Finally, the overall physics objective reported in the Pareto analysis is 

Jphys = max( C1, C 2, C 3, C 4),

so that any strong violation in one channel dominates the physics score. 

3-D Pareto selection. We use Pareto dominance and crowding distance in the three dimensional objective space ( Jerr , J comp , J phys ): individuals are ranked into Pareto fronts, crowding distance promotes coverage of the trade-off surface, and tournament selection favours non-dominated individuals with large crowding distance while maintaining predictive pressure toward low Jerr .Crucially, Jphys is not folded into the fitness as a weighted penalty; treating physics as an independent axis avoids arbitrary weighting and yields cleaner trade-off. 

Variation, elitism and termination. From the se-lected parents, crossover, mutation, and direct reproduc-tion are applied with prescribed probabilities to form the next generation; a small elite subset of the current Pareto front is copied unchanged. After a fixed number of gener-ations, the final 3-D Pareto front is exported, and candi-date correlations are chosen by inspecting the trade–off between fitness, complexity, and physicality within the constraints.   

> III. RESULTS A. Pareto Trade-off

The multi-objective search produces a final popula-tion evaluated by three criteria: the data fitness Jerr ,the structural complexity Jcomp (node count), and the physics score 

Jphys = max( C1, . . . , C 4), where smaller values are preferable in all objectives. Rather than visualizing the outcome in a three dimensional scatter space, we re-port the results as objective values versus population in-dex and as robustness summaries for selected candidates. Each point corresponds to one symbolic individual after convergence of the multi-objective GP run; lower values are preferable in all three coordinates. Blue markers de-note all individuals, while red markers indicate the non-dominated subset (Pareto front). This representation makes it easier to identify clusters of high-performing so-lutions and to locate specific candidates by index, while revealing the expected trade-off: individuals with very low Jerr often require higher complexity Jcomp or ex-hibit weaker physics compliance (larger Jphys ), whereas strongly physics-compatible solutions typically sacrifice some predictive accuracy. From the Pareto set we se-lected four representative candidates (Table II), span-ning different compromises among error, complexity, and physics score. Two different runs, namely run A and run B, are examined to extract candidate equations. Run B has a stricter constraint check procedure compared to Run A. Candidate 1 (index 714) given in Eq. 53 offers the best pure data fit and very good physics compliance, at the cost of being the most complex. As seen in Fig. 9, its dashed curves track the Nikuradse and smooth-pipe data closely across all roughness levels and reproduce the smooth–rough transition with realistic curvature.

Candidate 4 (from a separate run) given in Eq. 56 attains a training error comparable to the best models (Jerr ≈ 0.0123) with similar complexity (45 nodes), while keeping a competitive physics score ( Jphys ≈ 0.161). Its structure differs noticeably from Candidates 1–3: in-stead of a single dominant power–law/exponent-gated roughness term, it combines (i) a smooth activation term in Re through tanh(32950 /Re + 1 .38), (ii) a weak power-law correction in ( ·)0.1584 , and (iii) two Reynolds-dependent “switch” factors of the form ( a/x 2)c/Re =exp  (c/Re ) ln( a/x 2). These exponential-like factors are close to unity at high Re but can noticeably modulate the prediction at moderate Re , providing additional flexibil-ity in the smooth–rough transition. The explicit viscous correction −27 .38 /Re further helps shape the smooth-branch behaviour. Overall, Candidate 4 can be viewed as a viable alternative that matches the Nikuradse trends 13 well with similar complexity; we therefore retain it as a strong contender pending further validation.

(57d) For clarity, we analyse only the four nonlinear contri-butions T1-T4; the additive bias in Eq. (53) is a constant offset and does not affect the regime structure. The term structure is not arbitrary: it mirrors the canonical decomposition of pipe friction into a smooth-wall Reynolds-number dependence, a rough-wall plateau, and a rapid smooth rough crossover familiar from the Moody Diagram, Nikuradse’s sand-grain data, and Colebrook-type interpolation. Below we interpret each term in this context, drawing connections to modern high-Re friction laws and to outer-layer similarity ideas often used to rationalize rough-wall scaling.   

> 1. Term T1: Fully Rough Wall Contribution

The leading explicit roughness term T1 = 0 .2544 ( ε/D )supplies the dominant fully rough scaling. In the limit 

Re → ∞ at fixed ε/D , the friction factor effectively in-dependent of Re , producing the well-known horizontal plateaux of Moody diagram. This behaviour is exper-imental signature of the fully rough regime mapped by Nikuradse and later embedded in Colebrook-White: once viscosity no longer controls the near-wall stress, drag is set primarily by relatively roughness. In the perspective of outer-layer similarity, roughness introduces a geomet-ric length scale that replaces the viscous scale in set-ting the wall stress, so the leading dependence is on ε/D 

rather than on Re . Candidate 1 enforces this physics explicitly through T1, yielding (for high Re): 

f1 ≈ 0.2544 εD + (subdominant corrections) (58) Although classical fully-rough laws are often written in logarithmic form (e.g. via a roughness function shift in the log law, and thus a log dependence on ε when expressed as 1 /√f ), over the moderate roughness range represented in Nikuradse/Superpipe-style datasets an ap-proximately linear leading-order dependence of f on ε/D 

can act as an effective surrogate; here T1 provides pre-cisely that leading roughness sensitivity.   

> 2. Term T2: Roughness Onset Gate

The most distinctive feature of Candidate 1 is the highly nonlinear term T2, which activates roughness de-pendence only beyond a threshold in ( Re, ε/D ). By defining 

z(Re, ε/D ) = 



0.9937 + 1

Re (ε/D )0.9736 

118 .2

, (59) We have T2 = 0 .1663 ( ε/D )z . This makes clear that the large exponent 118 .2 does not represent a new phys-ical power law; it acts as a steepness parameter for a smooth blending function. Mathematically, a large outer power turns a modest change in the base into an abrupt change in z so T2 behaves like a quasi-step activation (a ”soft Heaviside”), analogous in effect to using a logistic 14 or tanh -type switch with a large slope to blend between smooth and rough asymptotes. Candidate 1 makes the switching mechanism explicit in an algebraic form. Because the outer exponent 118 .2 makes z extremely sensitive when the base crosses unity, we define an onset Reynolds number ’ Re on ’ and set the base in (59) to unity, giving 

Re on (ε/D ) ≈ 1(1 − 0.9937) ( ε/D )0.9736 ≈ 1.59 × 10 2

(ε/D )0.9736 

(60) For Re ≲ Re on , the base exceeds unity so z grows rapidly; since ε/D < 1, ( ε/D )z collapses and T2 is effec-tively inactive, consistent with a hydraulically smooth response in which roughness elements are submerged within the viscous-affected near-wall region. For Re ≫

Re on , the base approaches 0 .9937 and z saturates to a moderate value z ≈ (0 .9937) 118 .2 ≈ 0.47, so ( ε/D )z

is no longer vanishingly small and T2 contributes at 

O(ε/D 0.47 ). In this sense, T2 provides an explicit and interpretable analogue of the smooth to rough crossover embedded in Colebrook-type formulas: it introduces a sharp transition band in Re whose location scales ap-proximately as Re on ∝ (ε/D )−1, consistent with the classical notion that transition is governed by a rough-ness Reynolds Number (roughness size measured in wall units) reaching O(1) to O(10 2).

The term T3 carries the principal Reynolds-number de-pendence of Candidate 1 when ε/D is small (hydrauli-cally smooth) or when roughness has not yet been ac-tivated by T2. In the limit ε/D → 0, T1 → 0 and T2

is strongly suppressed, so the model reduces primarily to the Re -dependent structure in T3 (with a weak correction from T4). The explicit appearance of 1 /Re inside the base raised to a fractional power (0 .4667) gives T3 enough flex-ibility to reproduce the observed curvature of the smooth friction curve: a relatively rapid decrease at moderate 

Re that progressively weakens at higher Re as the flow approaches the logarithmic asymptote. This interpreta-tion is aligned with high-Re smooth-pipe measurements from the Princeton Superpipe, a facility developed to ac-cess very large Re D and thereby assess friction-factor relations and their associated universal constants over an extended range of Reynolds number. In particular, McKeon et al. [20], using Superpipe friction data up to 

Re D = 3 .5 × 10 7, showed that the constants in Prandtl’s universal friction relation are accurate only over a limited Reynolds-number range and become increasingly biased at higher Re D , motivating revised constants grounded in a logarithmic-overlap description of the mean velocity profile. In Candidate 1, T3 plays the analogous role: it supplies the smooth-wall backbone that captures finite-

Re curvature across the combined Nikuradse/Superpipe parameter range before roughness contributions ( T1–T2)become active.   

> 4. Term T4: Weak Interaction Correction

The remaining term T4 is deliberately weak: its expo-nent is −0.029, so 

x−0.029 = exp   − 0.029 ln x ≈ 1 − 0.029 ln x, 

i.e. T4 provides a near-logarithmic correction over wide ranges of x. Accordingly, T4 does not determine the leading asymptotic behaviour; instead it fine-tunes the intermediate curvature and the quantitative matching between the smooth-wall trend (dominated by T3) and the roughness-controlled plateau (anchored by T1, with transition shaped by T2). The mixed dependence in the bracket of T4 combines ε/D and 1 /Re in a way that naturally produces small, smooth shifts across the transition without introducing non-physical inflections. From an engineering-correlation perspective, T4 plays the role of a gentle ”shape corrector” that can adjust the depth/curvature of the Colebrook-like shape transition while preserving the correct limits as Re → ∞ and/or 

ε/D → 0.  

> 5. Synthesis and Implications

Candidate 1 can therefore be read as an explicit com-posite correlation that recovers the standard three-part structure of turbulent pipe friction. Term T3 provides a Superpipe-consistent smooth-wall dependence on Re ;term T1 anchors an Re -independent roughness-controlled plateau; term T2 supplies a sharp but continuous ac-tivation of roughness effects, mathematically analogous to a steep logistic/ tanh blending function and consis-tent with the narrow smooth–rough crossover observed in Nikuradse data; and term T4 adds a weak, nearly log-like interaction correction that improves quantitative curvature without altering the asymptotic regime struc-ture. This decomposition addresses the common inter-pretability concern associated with large exponents and small coefficients: the large exponent in T2 primarily controls switch sharpness, while the small exponent in 

T4 produces a gentle corrective adjustment. Taken to-gether, the four terms constitute a compact explicit rep-resentation of the classical picture encoded implicitly by Colebrook–White and refined by modern high-Re mea-surements: smooth-wall decay with increasing Re , an abrupt transition band whose location scales approxi-mately as ( ε/D )−1, and an Re -independent fully rough tail governed primarily by ε/D .15

FIG. 13: Constraint checks for Candidate 1 (Eq. (53)), evaluated over the same parameter ranges as the OMA reference. Panels (a)–(d) correspond to C1–C4, respectively.  

> C. Constraint behaviour of Candidate 1

Figures 13a–13d show the four constraint checks for Candidate 1 (Eq. (53)), evaluated in the same parameter ranges as for the OMA reference. Here χ, s, α, and γ de-note the local logarithmic exponents of ∆ P with respect to U m, ε, μ, and ρ, respectively. 

C1 (velocity exponent χ). In Fig. 13a, the dashed curves for Candidate 1 stay close to the OMA enve-lope: for all tested roughness values and across Re ∈

[2 .5 × 10 3, 10 6], the velocity exponent lies between about 1.7 and 2 .2 and approaches 2 toward the high-Re end. This behaviour follows directly from Eq. (53): in the smooth regime the residual 1 /Re -like dependence inher-ited from T3 produces an effective exponent slightly be-low 2, whereas in the rough regime the nearly constant plateau f ≈ 0.25 ε/D forces ∆ P ∝ ρU 2 

> m

so that χ → 2. The slight increase in χ near the smooth–rough transi-tion indicates finite-Re interaction between T2 and T3.However, the curves remain within the OMA-based ad-missible band, resulting in a low C1 score. 

C2 (roughness exponent s at fixed Re ). Figure 13b shows s = ∂ log ∆ P/∂ log ε at Reynolds-number slices in the turbulent regime. For each slice, the dashed curves increase monotonically with ε and remain non-negative, so the model respects the requirement that ∆ P should not decrease when the wall becomes rougher. At very small ε/D the exponent s stays close to zero, consistent with the dominance of the smooth 1 /Re term in Eq. (53). As ε/D enters the transition range, the activation of T2

and the growing linear term T1 cause s to rise toward val-ues around 0 .3–0 .4, matching the OMA envelope and the curvature of the Nikuradse rough branches. The steeper rise of the dashed curves relative to Haaland reflects that Eq. (53) contains an explicit ε/D prefactor (through T1), whereas the Haaland correlation embeds roughness more implicitly in the logarithm. 

C3 (viscosity exponent α at fixed U m). In Fig. 13c the dashed curves show how α = d log ∆ P/ d log μ varies with μ for several roughness levels at a fixed bulk ve-locity. For small ε/D and moderate Re the model be-haves as expected from the OMA decomposition: α ≈

0.3, reflecting a mix of viscous and turbulent contribu-tions. As μ decreases (so Re increases), the combinations 1/(Re (ε/D )p) in T2 and T4 decay and the rough plateau term T1 dominates. In this limit, the friction factor be-comes nearly independent of μ, and α → 0. The small negative excursions of α visible for the roughest pipes arise when the 1 /Re -dependent part of T3 overcompen-sates the fading viscous contribution; these are confined 16 to high-Re , rough conditions where the OMA model itself predicts a very weak μ-sensitivity. 

C4 (density exponent γ at fixed U m). Finally, Fig. 13d reports γ = d log ∆ P/ d log ρ. Because f(1) de-pends on ρ only through Re , increasing ρ at fixed U m, μ 

both multiplies ∆ P by ρ and drives Re upward. In the smooth regime the 1 /Re contribution counteracts part of the explicit ρ factor, leading to γ < 1; in the fully rough regime the Re -dependence is negligible and ∆ P ∝ ρU 2

> m

,so γ → 1. The dashed curves in Fig. 13d follow exactly this pattern: they rise monotonically with ρ, stay pos-itive, and asymptote to a value close to one, in good agreement with the OMA envelope. This yields a low 

C4 score while allowing subtle deviations from Haaland in the intermediate range where the data exhibit some scatter. Overall, the constraint curves of Candidate 1 remain close to the OMA-based envelopes in all four projections while tracking the Nikuradse-like transitions more faith-fully than the Haaland correlation. The candidate models presented above employ only the four base physical constraints of Section II C, which enforce regime-consistent scaling without restricting the internal mathematical structure. A consequence of this flexibility is that the optimization can produce exponents of order O(10) 2, as seen, e.g., in Eq. 53. Although such values exceed what traditional engineering practice typ-ically considers comfortable, where exponents of order unity are preferred, they arise here to achieve sharp but continuous regime transitions. Additional constraints based, e.g. on engineering expe-rience, can be incorporated to suppress large exponents. However, a single correlation with fixed exponents can-not be expected to represent vastly different operating conditions, such as high-density turbulent liquid-metal flows versus low-density flows at supercritical pressure and temperature conditions. The aim of this work is therefore to provide a robust framework that can be adapted for specific cases of engineering interest.  

> D. Validation on rough Superpipe datasets

A final check of the learned correlation is performed on rough-pipe measurements from the Princeton/Oregon ”Superpipe” facility. In addition to the smooth-pipe datasets of Swanson et al. [18] (Oregon) and Zagarola et al. [21] (Princeton), which were already included in the training set, we consider two rough-pipe campaigns that were not used for training: the sand-blasted pipe of [22], and the honed pipe of [23]. These four datasets span the effective roughness ratios of 

ε/D ≈ 7.6×10 −6 (Swanson et al.), 3 .4×10 −6 (Zagarola & Smits), 5 .9 × 10 −5 (Shockling et al.), and 6 .2 × 10 −5

(Langelandsvik et al.), all at Reynolds numbers up to 

Re ∼ 10 7. The latter two cases therefore provide an out-of-sample test in roughness: their ε/D values are almost an order of magnitude larger than the Nikuradse sand-grain pipes used during training. Figure 14 compares these four datasets with the Haa-land correlation and with the symbolic regression of Candidate 1. For the two nearly smooth Superpipe smooth Superpipe datasets (Swanson [18] and Zagarola 

et al. [21]) the SR curve follows the data almost in-distinguishably from Haaland across the whole turbu-lent range, confirming that the learned correlation pre-serves the classical ∆ P ∝ Re −0.25 behaviour in the hy-draulically smooth regime and smoothly connects to the laminar-turbulent transition already demonstrated in the Nikuradse-based Moody plot. For the rough Shockling [22] and Langelandsvik [23] pipes, the situation is more demanding. Here, the SR model is required to extrapolate in ε/D beyond the Niku-radse training range while retaining the correct asymp-totic region f ∼ const( ε/D ) at very large Re . In Fig. 14, the SR prediction (dashed) and Haaland (solid) both cap-ture the overall level and weak Reynolds–number depen-dence of the data, with the Candidate 1 curve lying be-tween the two rough datasets over most of the range. Systematic deviations are visible in the fully rough re-gion, where the SR model slightly underestimates the Shockling/Langelandsvik friction factors at the highest Reynolds numbers. This discrepancy is comparable in magnitude to the mismatch between Haaland and the same data, and likely reflects a combination of uncertain-ties in the effective roughness height of the Superpipe inserts and the known differences between Nikuradse’s uniform sand–grain roughness and the machined surfaces used in the Superpipe facility. Overall, the Superpipe validation indicates that the physics-informed SR model generalizes reasonably well to roughness levels that were not present in the training set. It preserves the desired smooth-pipe asymptotics and the correct trend toward a roughness-controlled plateau, while exhibiting deviations in the extreme rough regime that are similar to those of the widely used Haaland approximation. This suggests that the combination of dimensional analysis, order-of-magnitude-based constraints, and multi-objective sym-bolic regression produces a friction-factor correlation that is both interpretable when applied to independent high-Re rough-pipe experiments.  

> E. Robustness of Symbolic Candidates

To evaluate how robust each candidate equation is against variations in regression coefficients, we apply a perturbation of ±1% (uniform, multiplicative noise) and reassess the model response. Here, the goal is instead to probe how sensitive each discovered functional form is to small changes in its fitted constants—a practical proxy for the identifiability and numerical conditioning of the learned symbolic mechanisms. We evaluate robustness of all Candidate equations at three representative ( Re, ε/D ) points chosen to span dis-17 

FIG. 14: Independent high-Re validation of friction-factor predictions for rough pipes. Experimental data (markers) are shown for four nominal ε/D levels (see legend); the Haaland correlation (solid) and the SR model (dashed) are overlaid. The SR model reproduces the observed trends from Re ∼ 10 5 to 10 8 across both low-roughness and fully rough–leaning cases, demonstrating generalization beyond the training set. tinct regimes of the Moody map: a hydraulically smooth case (small ε/D ), a fully rough case (large ε/D at high 

Re ), and an intermediate/transitional case (moderate Re 

at appreciable roughness). This regime-based selection helps distinguish regression candidates that are globally stable from those that are only locally stable in certain re-gions of ( Re, ε/D ) space. For each trial, we compute the signed deviation of Jerr and Jerr relative to the nominal (unperturbed) prediction at the same operating point. Those deviations are defined as ∆Jerr = (fdev − fnom )/f nom (61) ∆Jphys = Jphys ,dev − Jphys ,nom (62) The distributions of deviations at three different points are shown in Fig. 15 for Candidate 1. The physics-score deviations are more difficult to interpret directly because 

Jphys is assembled via non-smooth operations (e.g. max-ima over constraint components and clipping). As a result, small coefficient changes can trigger constraint switching (changes in the active Ck) or move a point across a tolerance boundary, producing asymmetric and sometimes discontinuous changes in Jphys . This explains why ∆ Jphys can appear non-Gaussian or even bimodal in Fig. 15, and motivates quantile-based summaries rather than variance-only measures when reporting robustness. We summarize the central 95% interval of the signed prediction deviation ∆ Jerr and the corresponding change in physics score ∆ Jphys in Fig. 16a and b, respectively. Black tick marks in those figures indicate the sample median. Haaland exhibits a clear deterioration at the transitional point (Point 3), consistent with the fact that a smooth implicit correlation is not tuned to local con-straint envelopes in that regime. Candidate 4 is com-paratively well-behaved under coefficient noise: its inter-vals remain narrow at all three points, and its medians stay close to zero, indicating that its mechanisms respond smoothly to small constant variations. Candidates 1–3 show markedly wider tails, i.e. occasional large excursions despite medians remaining near zero. This sensitivity is consistent with sharp “gating” substructures (large outer exponents and threshold-like factors), where small coef-ficient changes can shift an internal transition boundary and produce amplified changes at specific ( Re, ε/D ) loca-tions. In that sense, the sensitivity is not purely a defect: it reflects high confidence in a narrow transition band, while the median behaviour indicates typical robustness away from rare boundary shifts.

By combin-ing classical similarity ideas [5, 6] with multiobjective genetic programming [12, 16], the approach searches di-rectly for explicit algebraic models that balance predic-tive accuracy, structural simplicity, and physics-based regime/envelope requirements. Unlike conventional single-objective curve fitting and many data-only symbolic regression studies, our for-mulation (i) enforces physical constraints spanning the smooth, transitionally rough, and fully rough behaviors and (ii) treats model selection as a Pareto decision rather than a single ”best-fit” outcome. This perspective is particularly relevant for rough-pipe friction, where the canonical experimental and engineering references high-light distinct regimes and nontrivial transition behavior [1–3, 8, 22, 23]. A central contribution of the study is that the OMA is not used merely as qualitative intuition, but as a constructive model scaffold. Starting from the mo-mentum/energy balance, the pressure drop is decom-posed into viscous and turbulence-associated contribu-tions, which motivates a friction-factor structure con-taining a Reynolds-number-decaying component and a roughness-controlled component. To capture the transi-tion minimum, we smoothly blend the viscous and tur-bulent limits using a ε/D, Re -dependent switch. This OMA-based approach provides two practical benefits: it yields an interpretable baseline correlation and, more importantly, it supplies quantitative envelope expecta-tions for sensitivity exponents ( C1–C4), which become lightweight, model-only constraints that guide symbolic regression toward regime-consistent behavior. A second contribution is a robustness characterization targeting the discovered equations themselves. Rather than perturbing physical inputs, we perturb the fitted regression coefficients to probe numerical conditioning and sensitivity of the symbolic structure—an important practical consideration when models contain sharp non-linear ”gating” mechanisms. The resulting robustness summaries complement regime-wise physical interpreta-tions and help distinguish between models that are accu-rate but brittle and those that remain stable under small coefficient uncertainty. Finally, beyond reproducing the training datasets, we validated the correlation learned in independent rough Superpipe campaigns that were not used for training [22, 23]. These delicate cases provide an out-of-sample test in ε/D at very high Reynolds numbers, where the model must extrapolate in roughness while preserving 19 the correct smooth-pipe asymptotics and the trend to-ward a roughness-controlled plateau. The symbolic cor-relation generalizes reasonably to these conditions, with deviations in the extreme rough tail comparable to those of widely used explicit engineering approximations [3]. This validation supports the broader claim that combin-ing OMA guidance with multiobjective physics-informed SR can produce correlations that are both interpretable and practically transferable. Overall, the results show that physics-guided multi-objective symbolic regression can recover interpretable, deployable friction-factor correlations that remain con-sistent with classical pipe-flow datasets and correla-tions across regimes, while providing an explicit trade-off surface for accuracy–simplicity–physics compliance. In particular, the framework offers a pathway for ex-tending friction-factor predictions to extreme thermal-hydraulic environments, such as liquid metal-cooled nu-clear reactors, supercritical water systems, and corroded high-temperature industrial equipment and components, where standard correlations like Haaland’s, calibrated primarily from conventional air and water data, may require refinement or replacement. The methodology is general and can be ported to other dimensionless-correlation problems where regime structure and asymp-totics are known but flexible functional forms are desired.
