# Abstract              

> Calabi–Yau manifolds are essential for string theory but require computing intractable metrics. Here we show that symbolic regression can distill neural approximations into simple, interpretable formulas. Our five-term expression matches neural accuracy ( R2= 0 .9994) with 3,000-fold fewer parameters. Multi-seed validation confirms that geometric constraints select essential features, specifically power sums and symmetric polynomials, while permitting structural diversity. The functional form can be maintained across the studied moduli range ( ψ∈[0 ,0.8]) with coefficients varying smoothly; we interpret these trends as empirical hypotheses within the accuracy regime of the locally-trained teachers ( σ≈8−9% at ψ̸= 0). The formula reproduces physical observables— volume integrals and Yukawa couplings—validating that symbolic distillation recovers compact, interpretable models for quantities previously accessible only to black-box networks.
> I. INTRODUCTION

String theory compactifications on Calabi–Yau threefolds determine observable particle physics through their K¨ ahler geometry. Computing explicit Ricci-flat metrics is essential for calculating Yukawa couplings [13, 14], studying moduli-space geometry, and verifying topological string predictions. However, solving the Monge–Amp` ere equation—the defining PDE for Ricci-flat metrics—is computationally intractable, typically requiring O(10 2 − 10 3)CPU-hours per metric point via classical methods [1]. Recent neural network surrogates [2, 15, 16] achieve millisecond-scale evaluation but sacrifice interpretability: learned weights encode metric structure in forms inaccessible to human intuition. This mirrors a broader challenge in scientific AI [18, 19], where the demand is not merely for prediction but for recovering the generative mechanisms underlying complex phenomena [7]. 

Research question: Do metric observables admit compact analytic forms that are both learnable from data and retain interpretability—and if so, does their structure remain invariant across moduli space? 

Here we show the answer is yes. We apply and sharpen a symbolic distillation framework to obtain a compact five-term analytic formula that maintains surrogate-level accuracy for Calabi–Yau metrics. Within the studied Dwork family range ( ψ ∈ [0 , 0.8]), we find that all moduli points can be fitted with the same five-term scaffold ,2with coefficients exhibiting hierarchical modulation —singular terms undergo sign reversal while bulk terms monotonically strengthen. We treat these cross-moduli trends as empirical findings, noting that teacher accuracy at ψ̸ = 0 ( σ ≈ 8 − 9%) limits precise geometric determination. This approach builds on recent successes in discovering physical laws from data [7, 8] and complements concurrent work on symmetry-aware symbolic potentials [24]. On the Fermat quintic, our formula achieves R2 = 0 .9994 with a 3 ,000 × parameter reduction. By refitting the formula across the Dwork family, we observe that the discovered functional form continues to fit the studied Dwork deformations, with geometric changes encoded in smoothly varying coefficients. This results in a symbolic model that tracks the neural surrogate with ≈ 2% relative error on volume integrals for 0 ≤ ψ ≤ 0.8. All such accuracy statements are defined relative to the neural surrogate, which itself approximates balanced metrics.   

> II. METHODS AND DATA A. Neural Surrogate and Validation

We use Donaldson’s balanced metrics at polynomial degree k = 10, represented by an H-matrix with 875 parameters (the basis size for quintic hypersurfaces at this degree) [1]. This “teacher” represents a global algebraic metric where the coefficients are learned by minimizing the Monge–Amp` ere (MA) loss. We define the Ricci-flatness indicator σ(η) as the standard deviation of η = det( g) |Ω|2/ det( gFS ), where η ≡ 1 for an exact Ricci-flat metric. On the Fermat quintic ( ψ = 0), the teacher achieves σ(η) = 0 .0065 (0.65%), validating the high precision of the algebraic surrogate. 

Why σ Measures Ricci-Flatness. For a Ricci-flat metric, the Monge-Amp` ere equation requires det( g) ∝ | Ω|2 where Ω is the holomorphic volume form. On a compact CY with 

h0(KX ) = 1, this proportionality must be constant. Therefore σ = 0 ⇔ Ricci-flat metric. In practice, σ < 1% indicates excellent approximation. 

Training Protocol. We train separate H-matrices at each ψ ∈ { 0.0, 0.1, . . . , 0.8}:1. Initialization: Identity H-matrix at each ψ

2. Sampling: Generate 10 5 points uniformly on the quintic 33. Optimization: Minimize LMA for 15 iterations using Adam 4. Validation: Compute σ and physics benchmarks For cross-moduli analysis on the Dwork family ( ψ̸ = 0), we train separate H-matrices at each ψ ∈ { 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8} to maintain high-fidelity teachers ( σ ≈ 8 − 9%) across the moduli range. This isolates symbolic approximation error from teacher degradation, ensuring that observed coefficient trajectories reflect genuine geometric structure. For comparison, zero-shot transfer (training at ψ = 0 and evaluating at ψ̸ = 0) yields σ ≈ 30% at ψ = 0 .8, demonstrating the necessity of local training for precision moduli studies.  

> B. Dataset and Regression Target

We sample 10 5 points uniformly on the Fermat quintic with homogeneous coordinates [z0 : z1 : z2 : z3 : z4] normalized as P |zi|2 = 1. The symbolic regression target is: 

y = log

, (1) where galg is the validated algebraic metric (0.65% Ricci error) and gFS is the Fubini–Study metric. 

Features. We use two gauge-invariant geometric invariants constructed from the power sums pk = P4

|zi|2k:

• Power sum : p2 = P4

• Third elementary symmetric polynomial : σ3 = 16 (1 − 3p2 + 2 p3), where p3 =

> i=0

|zi|2 = 1, Newton’s identities relate the power sums {pk}

and elementary symmetric polynomials {ek}. While higher invariants ( e4, e5) remain alge-braically independent, our empirical analysis shows they contribute minimally to the metric determinant ratio—the ( p2, σ 3) feature set captures 99.94% of explained variance. Recent work [24] has derived similar features from extrinsic symmetries theory; we independently validate sufficiency via ablation. 

Feature Ablation. To confirm the necessity of the symmetric term σ3, we performed an ablation study by restricting the regression to p2 alone. The best-performing 1-variable 4model achieves R2 = 0 .9981 (RMSE = 0 .0215). Restoring σ3 improves the fit to R2 = 0 .9994 (RMSE = 0 .0116), an error reduction of nearly 50%. This confirms that while the power sum p2 captures the radial bulk behavior, σ3 is essential for encoding the angular anisotropy required for Ricci-flatness.  

> C. Symbolic Regression

We applied PySR (Python Symbolic Regression) with 200 iterations, population size 60, maximum tree complexity 30 (measured in nodes, i.e., operators plus operands), and binary/unary operators {+, −, ×, ÷, log , √·} . We selected the best model using a Pareto criterion balancing loss and complexity: 

C∗ = arg min

, (2) yielding a 15-node expression (approximately 54% of the maximum complexity). The entire search ran on NVIDIA A100 GPU (Google Colab Pro). 

Independent Optimization at Each Moduli Point. Symbolic models were indepen-dently optimized at each ψ value, confirming emergent consistency of the five-term structure. No prior functional form was imposed; the same structure emerged spontaneously from sep-arate regression runs at different moduli points.

(3) using 10 5 training samples from the Donaldson H-matrix at ψ = 0. The resulting formula has 5 learnable coefficients (compared to 875 in the H-matrix), achieving a 175 × parameter reduction while maintaining R2 = 0 .9994 fit quality. 

Comparison to Neural Network Approaches. Unlike neural network surrogates that require ∼15,000 parameters [2], our symbolic formula uses only 5 terms with clear geometric interpretation. Mirjani´ c & Mishra [24] use graph neural networks with extrin-sic symmetry embedding; our approach extracts symmetry-informed features ( p2, σ 3) first, enabling interpretable symbolic regression. 5E. Power Sum Symmetries and Metric Determinants 

Why p2 and σ3? We establish the naturalness of our feature set from first principles. The Fubini-Study metric on P4 has determinant that depends only on power sums under the normalization P

|zi|2 = 1. Under the constraint e1 = P

|zi|2 = 1, Newton’s identities relate power sums pk =

|zi|2k to elementary symmetric polynomials ek:

p1 = e1 = 1 , (4) 

p2 = e1p1 − 2e2 = 1 − 2e2, (5) 

p3 = e1p2 − e2p1 + 3 e3 = p2 − e2 + 3 e3. (6) Solving for the elementary symmetric polynomials: 

e2 = 1 − p2

2 , e3 = σ3 = 1 − 3p2 + 2 p3

6 . (7) Thus, ( p2, σ 3) forms an empirically sufficient feature set for the metric determinant ratio in the regime we study. While the full algebra of gauge-invariant observables under U (1) 5×S5

admits additional generators ( e4, e5, or higher power sums), Newton’s identities ensure that (p2, σ 3) captures the dominant geometric variation for the determinant observable. The empirical sufficiency of this two-feature ansatz is validated via ablation (Sec. II.C) and cross-validation across 10 random seeds (Sec. III.C). 

Geometric Interpretation: 

• p2 captures radial anisotropy (deviation from spherical symmetry in projective space) 

• σ3 captures angular structure (three-way correlations among homogeneous coordi-nates)  

> F. The Factorization Conjecture

Our empirical observations motivate a formal conjecture about moduli-space structure: 

Conjecture 2.1 (Moduli Space Factorization). In the Dwork family of Calabi-Yau threefolds parameterized by complex structure modulus ψ ∈ [0 , 1), the metric determinant ratio admits the factorization: log

[0 , 0.8]) 2. The coefficient trajectories ci(ψ) encode moduli-space geometry 3. For small deformations ψ ≪ 1, coefficients vary smoothly with ψ

Theoretical Justification. By Kodaira-Spencer deformation theory, the tangent space to moduli space at the Fermat point is H1(X, T X ). For first-order deformations, metric corrections scale linearly with ψ:

ci(ψ) = c(0)

+ ψ · (∂ψci)|ψ=0 + O(ψ2). (9) This suggests that the Monge-Amp` ere equation, as a PDE constraint, restricts the functional form while leaving moduli-dependent coefficients to vary smoothly.  

> G. Linear Moduli Dependence Hypothesis

Hypothesis 2.2 (Linear Deformation). For the Dwork family in the regime ψ ∈ [0 , ψ c]with ψc < 1 (away from the conifold limit), coefficient trajectories satisfy: 

ci(ψ) ≈ Ai + Bi · ψ, (10) with three or more coefficients achieving R2 > 0.95 for linear fits. 

Theoretical Support: 

1. First-order perturbation theory: Near ψ = 0, metric corrections scale as O(ψ)2. Hodge theory: Period integrals of holomorphic 3-forms vary holomorphically with ψ

3. Empirical validation: Polynomial fits of degree > 1 show minimal R2 improvement (< 0.01 gain) 

Limitation at Conifold. As ψ → 1, the geometry develops singularities where linear approximation breaks down. Our study is limited to ψ ∈ [0 , 0.8]. 7III. RESULT 1: FIVE-TERM FORMULA MATCHES NEURAL SURROGATES WITH 3,000 × PARAMETER REDUCTION

c3 = +0 .1245, c4 = 0 .050. The structure reveals interpretable geometric information: the linear term c3p2 (= 0.125 p2) captures bulk metric behavior, and the mixed term c2σ3/p 32 (= −0.0011 σ3/p 32)represents angular anisotropy corrections. Empirically, terms of type 1 /p n 

> 2

appear in all 10 ensemble members, and removing them significantly degrades fit quality. This suggests that singular corrections are important in the learned representation. A rigorous derivation of the exact asymptotic order is beyond our current scope; we therefore present the singular terms as an empirical finding rather than a proven consequence of orbifold asymptotics. Empirically, the 1 /p 22 term is necessary for high-fidelity approximation ( R2 > 0.999 vs 0.998 without it). This expression is strikingly parsimonious: just five terms (four independent functional structures), each with clear geometric meaning. On the full 10 5-point Fermat dataset, the formula achieves R2 = 0 .9994 and RMSE = 0 .0116 relative to the neural surrogate. The necessity of both {p2, σ 3} was further validated via permutation testing (1,000 shuffles per feature), with both features showing p < 0.001 significance (see Appendix for details). It is important to note that while the symbolic fit to the teacher is near-perfect, the ultimate geometric accuracy is bounded by the teacher’s own Ricci-flatness error (0.997 against ground truth), which the student effectively inherits. 

Design choice: Interpretability over marginal accuracy. The ensemble search (Section B) converges to diverse functional forms that achieve comparable accuracy— including compact logarithmic structures with R2 = 0.9999. We select this five-term structure (Eq. 11) for physics benchmarks because each term carries explicit geometric interpretation. This design choice prioritizes explainability over marginal accuracy improve-ments, consistent with the paper’s emphasis on symbolic understanding. The consistency of {p2, σ 3} across all ensemble members validates that these are essential features , while 8the specific functional form is chosen for transparency.

We demonstrate that the functional form remains consistent across the studied Dwork family moduli range ( ψ ∈ [0 , 0.8]), with geometric deformations encoded entirely in smoothly varying coefficients. We interpret these trends cautiously given the teacher accuracy limita-tions at ψ̸ = 0 ( σ ≈ 8 − 9%). 9To demonstrate that symbolic regression provides a superior accuracy–complexity tradeoff over standard parametric fits, we compare three models on the 100k-point dataset:

The polynomial baseline uses degree 3 in ( p2, σ 3), yielding 10 coefficients; higher de-grees showed diminishing returns. Restoring σ3 improves the fit from R2 = 0 .9981 (RMSE = 0 .0215) for p2 alone to R2 = 0 .9994 (RMSE = 0 .0116), a 46% error reduction. The sym-bolic model outperforms this cubic polynomial with half the parameters. Crucially, while polynomials approximate the function via Taylor expansion, only symbolic regression recov-ers the singular 1 /p n

terms consistent with expectations from the asymptotic geometry near the orbifold locus [1]. The prominence of the 1 /p 22 term across independent symbolic regres-sion runs suggests it captures intrinsic curvature corrections required by the Monge-Amp` ere equation (see Methods for statistical validation). Compared to the algebraic surrogate, we achieve a 175 × parameter reduction with negligible accuracy loss.

The hierarchical moduli response reveals distinct geometric regimes: (1) singular correction terms ( c1, c3) undergo sign reversal near the Fermat point, indicating short-range metric corrections flip from enhancing to suppressing the Fubini-Study determinant; 10 TABLE III.

We therefore view the 5.5% as a conservative upper bound on total geometric + numerical error, not in contradiction with the local σ metric. This result confirms that the symbolic formula captures the volume integrals predicted by the neural surrogate to ≈ 2% across the sampled moduli range. 11 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8

Yukawa Coupling Benchmark 

The physical utility of the distilled metric is established via the Yukawa coupling κ111 , a key observable in string phenomenology. At the Fermat point ( ψ = 0), the exact value is 

κ111 = 5 (Candelas et al. 1991). Our computation yields: For κ111 at the Fermat point, the holomorphic/topological Yukawa is known to be 5, independent of the K¨ ahler metric. Our pipeline correctly reproduces this value, which is a sanity check on normalization and implementation, but does not by itself validate metric-dependent aspects. The trajectory shows the expected behavior: κ decreases slightly as 

ψ increases, consistent with deformation theory expectations. Metric-sensitive observables 12 FIG. 3. Physics Benchmark: Volume integral V (ψ) = R

The recent work of Mirjanic and Mishra [24] investigates symbolic approximations to the Kahler potential ϕ, deriving compact representations based on extrinsic symmetries. Our work is complementary yet distinct in three key aspects. First, we target the metric determinant ratio det g/ det gFS directly, which allows for simplified evaluation of physical observables without numerical differentiation of ϕ. Second, while they present exact solu-tions at specific symmetric loci, we provide an empirical framework for interpolation across the Dwork family, showing that coefficient trajectories ci(ψ) can capture moduli-dependence. Third, we establish the practical utility of these surrogates through direct physics bench-marks, namely Yukawa couplings and volume integrals, which were not addressed in [24].

A closely related concurrent work by Lee and Lukas [6] also develops analytic approxi-mations for Calabi-Yau metrics on the Dwork family. Their approach and ours are com-plementary , targeting different quantities with different trade-offs:

) that polynomial ansatze miss.  

> VII. DISCUSSION

Our validation demonstrates that symbolic formulas can approximate neural surrogates with comparable accuracy on the benchmarks we study. The Ricci-flatness indicator σ(η) = 0.81% for the symbolic formula vs. σ(η) ≈ 0.6% for the neural teacher shows that sym-bolic distillation introduces only ≈ 0.2% additional error—acceptable deviation beyond the teacher’s baseline. Yukawa integral tests ( ≈ 0.09% discrepancy) establish practical utility.  

> A. Hierarchical Modulation Principle and PDE Structure

The consistency we observe—fixed functional form with variable coefficients across the studied moduli range—parallels fundamental phenomena in mathematical physics: 

1. Renormalization Group (RG) Flow. In statistical mechanics, critical exponents are universal (depend only on symmetry and dimension), while system-specific parameters (couplings) flow along RG trajectories. By analogy: fi(p2, σ 3) ≈ characteristic functional forms, ci(ψ) ≈ running couplings. 

2. Integrable Systems. Soliton solutions have characteristic profiles; initial conditions determine amplitudes. Similarly, the Monge-Amp` ere equation constrains the functional form, while boundary conditions (moduli) determine coefficients. 

3. Physics-Informed Neural Networks. Embedding PDE constraints in network architecture improves generalization [21–23]. Our symbolic formula encodes Monge-Amp` ere 15 asymptotics in singular terms (1 /p n 

> 2

), explaining why 5 terms outperform 10-parameter polynomials. 

Mathematical Interpretation. The factorization suggests the solution space forms a low-dimensional fiber bundle: Solution Space ≈ { PDE-Constrained Forms }times {Coefficient Manifold (14) where the 5-dimensional PDE-constrained forms encode geometric structure, and the 1-dimensional coefficient manifold is parameterized by ψ. 

> B. Physical Interpretation: The Factorization Principle

The discovered formula exhibits factorization : the five-term structure encodes the PDE constraint (Ricci-flatness), while coefficient trajectories ci(ψ) encode moduli-space geom-etry. This establishes a design principle: symbolic complexity scales with physics constraints, not with problem dimensionality .

The observed sign reversal of c1 (from +0 .0022 at ψ = 0 to −0.0039 at ψ = 0 .2) and c3 (from +0 .12 to −0.04) suggests that metric corrections undergo a qualitative transition near the Fermat point: short-range corrections flip from enhancing to suppressing the Fubini-Study determinant. We interpret these trends as empirical hypotheses, noting that teacher accuracy at ψ̸ = 0 ( σ ≈ 8 − 9%) limits precise geometric determination. However, the consistent emergence of singular terms (1 /p n 

> 2

) across the ensemble suggests they capture relevant asymptotic behavior, even if the exact order is not rigorously derived. The consistent recovery of the functional form across the Dwork family (0 ≤ ψ ≤ 0.8) is supported by multi-seed validation at ψ = 0: across 10 independent runs, all solutions include p2 and a singular 1 /p n 

> 2

term, and 9/10 include σ3. The specific five-term scaffold in Eq. (11) is a representative, interpretable member of this family, not the unique struc-ture recovered across the ensemble. This confirms that key geometric features are robustly mandated by the Monge-Amp` ere constraint, while the precise algebraic representation ad-mits diversity. 16 C. Error Decomposition Analysis 

To isolate the sources of approximation error, we decompose the total discrepancy from the exact Ricci-flat metric into three components:                  

> TABLE VII. Error decomposition at different ψvalues. All errors are relative to the exact (un-known) Ricci-flat metric.
> ψTeacher Error Symbolic Approx. Extrapolation Total 0.0 0.6% 0.2% 0% ≈0.8% 0.4 5% 0.5% 0% ≈5.5% 0.8 9.4% 0.5% 0% ≈10%

Key Insight: The symbolic approximation contributes < 1% error across all ψ. With locally-trained teachers ( σ ≈ 8 − 9%), the total error budget remains below 10% across the Dwork family. For comparison, zero-shot transfer (training only at ψ = 0) yields σ ≈ 30% at ψ = 0 .8, confirming that local training is essential for precision moduli analysis.  

> D. Cross-k Validation: Curvature-Level Convergence

We validate structural stability across polynomial degrees k = 6 , 8, 10, providing curvature-level validation as requested by the reviewers. Donaldson’s theorem guarantees conver-gence of balanced metrics to the unique Ricci-flat K¨ ahler metric as k → ∞ . Our data confirms this convergence empirically:                 

> TABLE VIII. Curvature Convergence: Ricci-flatness error σ(η) decreases monotonically with ap-proximation degree, consistent with Donaldson’s theorem.
> kBasis Size σteacher (%) Convergence 6205 7.45 —8460 6.63 ↓11% improvement 10 875 0.61 ↓91% improvement

The Ricci-flatness error σ(η) decreases monotonically: 7 .45% → 6.63% → 0.61%, con-firming convergence to the unique Ricci-flat metric. This validates that our k = 10 teacher provides a high-fidelity approximation suitable for symbolic distillation. 17 Error Budget Analysis. We decompose the total approximation error into teacher, student, and distillation components:

The distillation loss (difference between teacher and student σ) remains < 1% across all k, demonstrating that the symbolic formula captures the essential geometric structure without introducing significant additional error. 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0 8.5 9.0 9.5 10.0

18 E. Runtime Benchmarks 

We systematically benchmark evaluation times for 10 6 points on an NVIDIA A100 GPU (Table X). The symbolic formula achieves 3 ,000 × speedup over the neural surrogate and 10 ,000 × over Donaldson H-matrix evaluation.

A hybrid approach—using their analytic ϕ to initialize our symbolic regression—could combine exactness at symmetric loci with flexibility away from symmetries. 19 G. Implications for String Phenomenology 

Our framework enables concrete applications in string phenomenology: 

Scenario 1: Yukawa Coupling Calculations. Physical Yukawa couplings λabc require integrating three matter field wavefunctions over X:

λabc =

Z

> X

Ω ∧ ψa ∧ ψb ∧ ψc · pdet g (15) Our formula enables fast evaluation of √det g at 10 6 points for numerical integration. Appli-cation: scanning moduli space to find points with hierarchical Yukawa structures (explaining fermion mass hierarchies). 

Scenario 2: Moduli Stabilization. Kahler moduli stabilization (KKLT, LVS) requires computing volume: Vol( X) = 

Z

> X

pdet g · J3/3! (16) Our 2% accuracy on volumes enables efficient moduli space scans, with 3 ,000 × speedup over retraining neural nets at each ψ.

Scenario 3: Worldsheet Instantons. Instanton corrections involve e−Vol( C) where 

C ⊂ X is a holomorphic curve. Our framework can train symbolic formulas for restricted metrics g|C .

Realistic Impact. Current bottleneck: evaluating observables at O(10 4–10 6) moduli points. Our method reduces per-point cost from minutes (Donaldson) or seconds (neural) to microseconds (symbolic), enabling parameter space exploration previously infeasible.  

> H. Limitations and Accuracy Regime

Our results are subject to four key constraints: 1. Teacher Noise at Deformations. Teachers at ψ̸ = 0 have σ ≈ 8 − 9%. Conse-quently, fine-grained features of the coefficient trajectories may be partially contami-nated by teacher noise. We interpret the observed trends as valid empirical hypotheses within this accuracy regime. 2. Global vs. Local Error. The 5.5% volume error is larger than the local σ ≈ 0.8%. This reflects the accumulation of Monte Carlo variance and integration error over the manifold, distinguishing global observable accuracy from local PDE violation. 20 3. Metric-Sensitive Observables. Our validation uses volume integrals (metric-dependent) and holomorphic Yukawa κ111 (metric-independent). More stringent tests— c2-related curvature integrals, Laplacian eigenvalues, or moduli kinetic terms— are left for future work. These require the full metric tensor or its inverse, not just the determinant ratio. 4. Single Family Scope. We validate on the Dwork quintic family only. Testing on other families (e.g., bi-cubic in P2 × P2 [6]) would strengthen claims of generality. The symmetric invariant basis ( p2, σ 3) is specific to the quintic; other families may require adapted feature sets. 5. Empirical Invariance. The stability of the functional form across moduli is an empirical observation from our experiments, not a rigorously proven geometric fact. 6. Scalability. Extending this to higher-dimensional moduli spaces requires automated teacher generation. While strictly a computational resource challenge, it necessitates efficient pipelines. Regarding cross-degree stability , our primary scope is k = 10. Preliminary validation at k = 6 , 8 (Figure 4) confirms the five-term structure persists, but full cross-k validation is left for future work.  

> VIII. BROADER SIGNIFICANCE

Our framework addresses a critical gap at the intersection of machine learning and theo-retical physics: the tension between neural network expressiveness and mathematical in-terpretability. This modular consistency principle —where PDE constraints govern functional form while moduli govern coefficients—extends beyond string geometry: sym-bolic distillation of neural PDE surrogates is applicable wherever high-dimensional PDEs appear—condensed-matter electronic structure via orbital-free density functional theory [25, 26], physics-informed neural networks for computational fluid dynamics [27], and machine learning-assisted gravitational wave detection [28, 29]. The shared principle—PDE structure imprints low-dimensional manifolds in solution space—suggests interpretable surrogates as a general paradigm for scientific AI. 21 Within string theory, the factorization we discover suggests systematic extraction of formulas for other geometric quantities—mirror maps, prepotentials, instanton ampli-tudes—and potentially extends to higher-dimensional moduli spaces and diverse CY families. This exemplifies physical AI : machine learning systems that not only fit data but highlight candidate functional structures reflecting underlying geometric principles, which can then be scrutinized analytically. Similar distillation strategies are being applied to graph neural networks [17] and deep learning explainability more broadly, establishing a pattern whereby knowledge flows from flexible black-box models into simpler, transparent surrogates.  

> IX. CONCLUSION

Interpretability distillation bridges neural efficiency and mathematical insight for Calabi– Yau metric computation. By combining fast neural approximation with symbolic regression, we recover explicit formulas enabling physics calculations inaccessible to either method alone. The key findings are: 1. Compactness: The five-term formula achieves R2 = 0 .9994 fidelity to the neural surrogate with 3 ,000 × parameter reduction, maintaining σ = 0 .81% Ricci-flatness accuracy at the Fermat point. 2. Hierarchical Moduli Response: The functional form is stable within the stud-ied moduli range ( ψ ∈ [0 , 0.8]), with coefficients exhibiting selective sensitivity —singular terms undergo sign reversal while symmetric terms strengthen monotonically. These trends are interpreted as empirical hypotheses given the moderate teacher ac-curacy ( σ ≈ 8 − 9%) in the deformed regime. 3. Physics fidelity: Reproduction of Yukawa coupling ( κ111 = 5) and volume integrals within 5 .5% of literature values validates utility for phenomenological scans, subject to the established error budget. This establishes a design principle— PDE constraints control functional complex-ity; moduli control coefficients —applicable to other geometric observables and poten-tially transformative for bridging neural efficiency and mathematical insight in scientific computing. This moduli-stable functional form within the studied range demon-strates that symbolic distillation can recover compact, interpretable, and modulus-dependent 22 analytic models for geometric quantities previously accessible only to black-box neural sur-rogates.

1. Ensemble Validation Method 

Protocol. For each random seed s:1. Generate independent train/test split (80%/20%) of 10 5 points from the same neural surrogate ( k = 10, ψ = 0) 2. Run symbolic regression (PySR v1.5.9) with 40 iterations, operators {+, −, ×, ÷, log , √·} 

3. Record: formula structure, R2, RMSE, and constituent features 

Key Distinction. We study multiple symbolic expressions of the same approx-imation —not multiple approximations. All 10 seeds fit the identical k = 10 teacher (Don-aldson H-matrix with σ ≈ 0.6%). 

2. Feature Robustness Results 

Critical Finding: Seed 7—which omitted σ3 entirely—achieved R2 = 0 .998 with 24 ×

higher RMSE than the median performer (0 .28 vs 0 .0116). This confirms that while multiple symbolic expressions exist, both p2 and σ3 are essential features for accurate approxima-tion. 24 TABLE XIII.

explainability over marginal accuracy gains (∆ R2 = 0 .0005), consistent with the paper’s emphasis on symbolic understanding. 25 Key Insight: Both Eq. 11 and Eq. B1 encode the same essential features {p2, σ 3}—their structural diversity is itself evidence that these features are necessary for accurate approximation, while many equivalent functional forms exist. The discovery of multiple high-accuracy expressions strengthens, rather than weakens, our core finding: geometric constraints select essential features, but permit representational flexibility.

Appendix D: Statistical Validation 

We perform rigorous statistical validation to confirm the robustness and significance of our symbolic regression results. 

1. Permutation Test for Feature Significance 

To rigorously validate that p2 and σ3 contribute genuine predictive power beyond random chance, we perform permutation testing with 1,000 random shuffles: 

TABLE XV. Permutation test results (N=1,000 permutations). Both features are highly significant (p < 0.001). 

Feature Baseline R ² p-value Significance 

p2 (power sum) 0.9992 < 0.001 *** 

σ3 (symmetric) 0.9992 < 0.001 *** *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01, * p < 0.05 

27 When either feature is shuffled, R ² drops catastrophically from 0.9992 to negative values (mean R ² = −16 .5 for shuffled p2, −6.9 for shuffled σ3), confirming both features encode essential predictive information beyond random correlation.  

> 2. Leave-One-Seed-Out Cross-Validation

To assess ensemble robustness, we perform leave-one-seed-out (LOSO) cross-validation: for each of the 10 seeds, we compute ensemble predictions using the remaining 9 seeds and evaluate performance on held-out data (N=10,000 points).            

> TABLE XVI. LOSO cross-validation confirms ensemble stability. No single seed dominates.
> Metric Mean ±Std Worst Case
> NRMSE 5.49% ±0.28% 5.89% R²0.9970 ±0.0003 0.9965

All LOSO configurations achieve NRMSE < 6%, confirming that the discovered feature set ( p2, σ3) is not an artifact of any particular optimization trajectory.  

> 3. Residual Analysis

Formal normality tests (Shapiro-Wilk W=0.986, Anderson-Darling A ²=34.68) reject strict Gaussian residuals at α = 0 .05. However, visual inspection of Q-Q plots (Figure 6) reveals that deviations are confined to the tails, consistent with the bounded nature of the manifold geometry. The central 95% of residuals follow a near-Gaussian distribution with 

σ ≈ 0.011.
