Abstract. The electron density at the separatrix ( ne, sep ) plays a central role in balancing energy confinement, detachment achievement, and ELM suppression in tokamaks, thereby influencing core-edge integration. To study what determines this key parameter, a database of H-mode separatrix density measurements from Alcator C-Mod, ASDEX Upgrade, and JET tokamaks has been assembled using a consistent analysis method across all devices. This dataset is used to derive a regression scaling

The agreement found is remarkable: both the regression and model provide similar parameter dependencies and tokamak-specific multiplicative constants. Building on this agreement, a fully predictive formula that combines the regression dependencies and the two-point model multiplicative constant is proposed. This formula is able to estimate ne, sep across the three machines within a factor of 1.5, and provides projections to next-step devices (ITER, SPARC, DTT, JT-60SA and COMPASS-U) that are in agreement with available SOLPS simulations.

1. Introduction 

One of the key open challenges on the pathway to building a fusion power plant based on the tokamak concept is the determination of a so-called core-edge integrated plasma scenario. In such a scenario, the plasma needs to combine high fusion energy production with acceptable heat and particle loads on first-wall materials, the latter usually achieved via pronounced detachment [1]. Moreover, transient heat loads induced by edge-localized modes (ELMs) should be avoided [2], along with plasma disruptions. The electron density at the separatrix ne, sep is a key parameter that influences the above-mentioned processes: It affects H-mode confinement by altering the pedestal stability [3, 4, 5, 6, 7], detachment achievement by influencing the required impurity concentration needed to detach [8, 9, 10], access to no-ELM regimes [11, 12, 13, 14], and it poses an upper limit to H-mode operation (the so-called density limit) [15, 16, 17]. Therefore, reliable, quantitative predictions of ne, sep are essential for evaluating and designing next-step fusion experiments and reactors. Several previous studies highlighted the connection between the (upstream) separatrix density and the (downstream) divertor target conditions, via the so-called two-point model [18, 19]. At DIII-D [20], JET [21] and WEST [22], ne, sep has been shown to be clearly linked to the measured electron temperature in the divertor region, as expected from the two-point model equations. In ASDEX Upgrade (AUG), a strong connection between the electron separatrix density and the sub-divertor neutral pressure 

p0,div has been observed both experimentally [23] and in simulations [24]. This finding has been reconciled with the two-point model by relating the target ion flux to the divertor neutral pressure. More recently, similar relationships connecting ne, sep to the divertor neutral pressure have been observed experimentally also in TCV [25], JET and Alcator C-Mod (C-Mod) [26], and in STEP SOLPS simulations [27]. It is important to note that p0,div can be regarded as an engineering parameter, since it is primarily set by the applied gas puff level and effective pumping speed of the system [23, 28], allowing for ne, sep predictions based only on engineering parameters. Indeed, in AUG this approach enabled core-pedestal-SOL integrated modeling of plasma discharges using solely engineering parameters as input [29]. However, the ne, sep formulas used so far always depend on tokamak-specific constants, which make extrapolation 2efforts challenging. Also, single-machine studies cannot unveil the size dependence of 

ne, sep , an important topic for extrapolation. To fill this gap, a multi-machine database of H-mode ne, sep values evaluated with the same procedure has been assembled, using data from three metal-wall devices: Alcator C-Mod, ASDEX Upgrade and JET. The collected data have been used to derive a cross-machine scaling of ne, sep , with machine specific multiplication constants. Regression analysis revealed that ne, sep reduces with increasing plasma minor radius (i.e. machine size), consistent with the associated increase of SOL connection length. The dependence of ne, sep to other engineering parameters, such as p0,div , Ip, Bt, PSOL /R , is also discussed and compared to the ne, sep expression given by the two-point model. Overall, the agreement found is remarkable, despite slight discrepancies in the exponents of p0,div 

and Bt which are further discussed. Perhaps more importantly, the two-point model multiplicative constant in the ne, sep expression is compared to the regression-inferred tokamak-specific constants, finding good agreement. This allowed the introduction of a predictive ne, sep formula based on the two-point model multiplicative constant and regression-based dependencies which proved able to predict ne, sep within a factor 1.5 across the three devices. Predictions to next-step devices such as ITER, SPARC, DTT, JT-60SA and COMPASS-U are carried out, finding ne, sep values in agreement with available SOLPS simulations. The content is organized as follows. In section 2, the database is described and correlations between parameters are discussed. In section 3, the cross-machine ne, sep 

scaling is introduced. In section 4, the two-point model expression for ne, sep is derived and compared with the regression findings. The predictive formula and its applicability are discussed in section 5, while predictions to next-step devices are presented in section 6. The conclusions are summarized in section 7. 

2. Database 

The database used in this work builds on the one assembled in [26], with some additional features that are discussed at the end of this section. The key characteristics of this database are: (i) Use of similar closed divertor (lower single null) configurations across the three devices; (ii) H-mode plasmas in favorable configuration—in JET with ELMs, in C-Mod without ELMs (the so-called EDA H-mode [30]), while in AUG a mixture of ELMy and no-ELM plasmas; (iii) Unseeded plasmas in JET and C-Mod, while both unseeded and seeded plasmas in AUG; (iv) Stationary phases in both plasma and sub-divertor neutral pressure, the latter measured by baratrons along vertical pipes, see Fig. 1 in Ref. [26]; 3C-Mod AUG JET Discharges 111 43 45

Table 1: Parameter range of the assembled database. (v) Separatrix parameters evaluated with exactly the same procedure based on power balance in each device. Concerning the last point, edge electron temperature and density profiles measured by Thomson scattering have been mapped to the outer midplane and fit with the same function in each device. Then, scrape-off layer (SOL) power balance has been applied to determine the electron temperature at the separatrix Te, sep , ensuring that the same pre-factors are used when evaluating Te, sep . A notable aspect of this power balance analysis is the direct evaluation of the inter-ELM temporal derivative of the plasma stored energy, 

dW/dt , via fast magnetic equilibrium reconstruction—a term that is often neglected or approximated as a constant fraction of the absorbed heating power. For additional details on the separatrix evaluation procedure, the reader is referred to [26]. The main plasma parameters of the assembled database are summarized in Table 1. Compared to the database shown in [26], additional high-field plasmas at Bt ≈ 7.8 T

Further, the JET dataset has been restricted to 4Figure 2: Correlation matrix of the variables used for the regression analysis. low triangularity plasmas only ( δav < 0.26). The reason for this choice resides in the additional dependency of ne, sep on triangularity found in JET ‘vertical-vertical’ (V-V) target configuration [26], which is the divertor configuration used in this study for JET. This dependency deserves a detailed study that goes beyond the scope of this paper, therefore it is left as a topic for future research. Figure 1 shows the achieved variation in plasma current ( Ip), on-axis toroidal magnetic field ( Bt), safety factor evaluated at the 95 % magnetic flux surface ( q95 ) and power entering the SOL ( PSOL ) in the three devices. A satisfactory variation and de-correlation of Ip and Bt is obtained in AUG and C-Mod, which is reflected in the broad range of 

q95 values spanned in both devices. In JET, while a good variation in Ip and Bt is obtained, these two values are mainly correlated, resulting in a small variation of q95 .Historically, this is due to the fact that experiments in V-V configuration at JET were mainly executed to be self-similar to ITER [32, 33], which is expected to operate a low 

q95 . The power entering the SOL exhibits also a good variation, as well as the line-averaged density ( ne) which is spanning more than one order of magnitude across the three devices, see table 1. The divertor neutral pressure p0,div , measured by a baratron located in the sub-divertor region [26], varies by about two orders of magnitude. As it is also shown in Appendix A, the divertor neutral pressure p0,div can be regarded as an engineering parameter set primarily by the injected particle flux and the effective pumping speed of the system [23, 28]. The tokamaks analyzed in this study have a nearly constant aspect ratio A = Rgeo /a geo =3.0−3.3, where Rgeo and ageo are the geometrical major and minor radii, respectively. As a result, Rgeo and ageo are fully correlated, and cannot be used together as independent variables in the regression analysis. Therefore, we use only ageo as a regression variable in this study, while Rgeo is employed solely as a normalization factor for PSOL . This choice is motivated by theoretical considerations, which will be discussed further in section 4. Figure 2 shows the correlation matrix of the variables chosen for regression analysis. A 5Figure 3: Experimental ne, sep values against those predicted by Eq. 1 for C-Mod (gray circles), AUG (red squares) and JET (blue crosses). good level of de-correlation is achieved between Ip, Bt, PSOL and p0,div . The same cannot be said for ageo , which shows a positive correlation with Ip and a negative correlation with Bt. Therefore, particular care should be taken with the ageo dependencies found in this study.

, where Cdev is a device-specific multiplication constant and 

αX is the exponent of the independent variable X. This expression has been chosen to facilitate comparisons with the two-point model, as will be discussed in the next section. Applying a generalized linear model with Gaussian likelihood and the logarithmic link function, the following scaling expression is obtained: 

ne, sep ,sc [10 19 m−3] = Cdev · (p0,div [Pa]) 0.20 ±0.03 · (Ip[MA]) 0.03 ±0.09 · (Bt[T]) −0.26 ±0.11 ·

Figure 3 shows the comparison between the experimental ne, sep data and those predicted by the scaling. A satisfactory agreement is found across more than one order of magnitude. Regression analysis reveals that the two parameters driving an increase in ne, sep are the divertor neutral pressure and PSOL /R geo , both exhibiting similar exponents ( ∼ 0.2). The observed dependence of ne, sep on PSOL /R geo aligns with previous studies at JET [21, 34] and DIII-D [20], which also reported a mild positive correlation between the two 6quantities. The dependence on p0,div is consistent with results from single-machine analyses [23, 26], with an exponent that most closely resembles the value reported for C-Mod. Moreover, 

Figure 4: Experimental ne, sep values normalized by the scaling expression in Eq. 1, excluding the dependence on the parameter shown on the x-axis: p0,div in (a) and ageo 

in (b). The residual scaling dependence on p0,div and ageo is plotted as a dashed line. Results from SOLPS gas scan simulations of an AUG H-mode plasma are shown in light red diamonds in panel (a). AUG SOLPS gas scan simulations confirm the experimental relationship found between 

ne, sep and p0,div , see Fig. 4 (a). The simulated discharge is a typical H-mode AUG plasma belonging to the database ( Ip = 1 MA, Bt = 2 .5 T, PSOL = 6 MW), where particle and heat diffusion coefficients have been chosen to fit upstream and downstream profiles. The subdivertor structure is similar to the one employed in Ref. [35], yielding a good match with the experimental subdivertor neutral pressure. Then, the input gas puff was scanned keeping constant transport coefficients. The obtained relationship between the output separatrix densities and neutral pressures is in good agreement with the experimental results, similarly to previous findings with SOLPS simulations [24]. Furthermore, a comparable relationship ( ne, sep ∝ p0.22 0,div ) has also been found in recent SOLPS-ITER gas scan simulations of the ITER Q=10 baseline scenario [36], increasing confidence in the applicability of this scaling in plasmas with high neutral opacity. The two parameters that lead to a decrease in ne, sep when increased are the plasma minor radius and the toroidal magnetic field Bt. A negative dependence on Bt was also observed experimentally in DIII-D [20], and was correlated with an increase of the SOL radiative fraction as Bt increases. Additionally, several tokamaks have reported a reduction in ne, ped with increasing Bt at fixed plasma current [37, 31, 20, 38], a trend that would be consistent with a corresponding decrease in ne, sep .The other quantity exhibiting a relatively strong negative correlation with ne, sep is ageo ,as also shown in Fig. 4 (b). This finding will be compared to the two-point model 7expectations in the next section. However, as expected from the discussion in section 2, a large error is associated to the ageo exponent, which calls for particular caution in the interpretation of this dependency. Lastly, the multi-machine regression finds no relevant dependence of ne, sep on the plasma current Ip. This result is consistent with previous observations in each single device [23, 26], which also reported an absent correlation with Ip upon normalizing 

ne, sep to the p0,div dependency. It should be noted that when ne, sep is not normalized to the p0,div dependency, a mild correlation with the plasma current is typically observed [23, 20, 39]. However, this mild correlation is thought to be due to the larger gas puff usually required at higher current to avoid impurity accumulation in H-mode. Indeed, employing a Z-test to our variables reveals that p0,div is a very strong statistical predictor (p-value of zero), while Ip is not a statistically significant predictor (p-value of 0.735). 

4. Two-point model expression for ne, sep as a function of engineering parameters 

In this section, an expression for ne, sep as a function of engineering parameters will be derived. This treatment is an extension of the one introduced by Kallenbach et al. in Ref. [23]. A SOL flux tube connecting the outer midplane to the outer divertor target is considered, as typically done with two-point modeling [18]. Key assumptions of the model used here are: (1) Ions and electrons have distinct temperatures and densities, Ti,

Te, ni, ne, with temperatures expressed in eV; (2) The upstream parallel velocity is zero, while the velocity at the target is the ion sound speed defined as cs =

q(1+ τ /z )eT e 

> mi

[18], where e is the electron charge, mi the ion mass, τ = Ti/T e and z = ne/n i; (3) All the power enters the flux tube at the upstream position and is transported in the parallel direction solely by electron conduction. Momentum and power sinks along the flux tube are parametrized by loss factors, defined as (1 − fmom )ptot ,u = ptot ,d and (1 −fpow )Pu = Pd for the momentum and power, respectively. The subscripts ‘u’ and ‘d’ stand for ‘upstream’ and ‘downstream’ positions along the flux tube, while P indicates the power and ptot the total plasma pressure, given by the sum of static and dynamic pressures. The four basic equations of the two-point model are given by momentum and power conservation, Fourier’s law to describe heat transport in the parallel direction, and a target boundary condition, which defines the target heat flux at the sheath entrance. 8These equations read: (1 − fmom )(1 + τu/z u)nuTu = 2(1 + τd/z d)ndTd (2) (1 − fpow )q|| ,uA⊥,SOL ,u = q|| ,dA⊥,SOL ,d ⇒ (1 − fpow )q|| ,u = q|| ,dbBu

q|| ,d = γeT dΓ|| ,d ⇒ q|| ,d = γeT dndcs, d (5) where q|| indicates the heat flux parallel to the magnetic field, A⊥,SOL the SOL flux bundle area perpendicular to the magnetic field line, B the total magnetic field, L|| the SOL parallel connection length between the outer midplane and the target, κe is the parallel electron conductivity coefficient, γ is the total sheath heat transmission factor, Γ|| ,d = ndcs, d is the parallel ion flux density (particles/m 2/s) at the sheath entrance, and 

b = λint /λ q = 1 + 1 .64 S/λ q is the divertor broadening factor, with λq and λint being the outer midplane heat flux decay length and the integral heat flux decay length at the target, respectively, while S is the broadening parameter. For a detailed overview of λq, λint and S, the reader is referred to Ref. [40, 41, 42]. Compared to the equations typically used for the two-point model [18, 23, 21], the main difference is in the factor 

Bu/B d in Eq. 3, which is typically approximated to be Bt, u/B t, d ∼ Rd/R u. However, to potentially model also alternative divertor configurations [43, 44] which could have different Bp, u/B p, d ratios, this approximation is not made here. Also, it is worth noting that the broadening factor b accounts for power losses perpendicular to the magnetic flux bundle in the divertor region. Therefore, in this formulation, the power loss factor 

fpow primarily reflects losses due to radiation and charge exchange reactions. A full derivation of Eq. 3 is described in the Appendix B. Combining Eq. 2, 3, 4 and 5, an expression for the upstream electron density ne, u as a function of q|| ,u, L|| and Γ || ,d is obtained: 

ne, u = 2(1 − fpow )1/2

, (6) which differs from the one derived in [23] by the additional pBd/B u and 1+ τ /z factors. This expression highlights the primary physics parameters affecting ne, sep . Both the ion flux density at the target and the upstream heat flux drive an increase in ne, sep , while extending the connection length between the outer midplane and the target reduces 

ne, sep . While Eq. 6 is extremely insightful to study what drives changes in ne, sep , it is not directly comparable with the regression, as the dependencies on engineering parameters are not made explicit. Therefore, in the next paragraphs a series of assumptions will be introduced to express ne, sep as a function of engineering parameters. To express q|| ,u and L|| as a function of Ip and Bt (on-axis toroidal magnetic field), the poloidally-averaged poloidal magnetic field ⟨Bp⟩ = μ0Ip/(2 πa geo ˆκ) and the cylindrical 9safety factor 

qcyl = ˆκa geo Bt

(7) are introduced, with ˆκ =

r1 + κ2(1 + 2 δ2 − 1.2δ3)2 (8) being an effective plasma elongation corrected for the triangularity, a parameter introduced in Ref. [45, 46] to account for the non-circular plasma cross-section. Alternative definitions of the cylindrical safety factor have been adopted in the literature and are discussed in Appendix C. Using the above-mentioned formulas, L|| can be expressed as: 

L|| = l∗πR geo qcyl = l∗ 2

l∗ is about 1.2, 1.3, and 1.1 for C-Mod, AUG and JET, respectively. To calculate this number the SOL connection length has been evaluated from the magnetic field line at approximately half λq [26]. Clearly, l∗ can be larger when alternative divertor configurations are considered. The upstream parallel heat flux can be rewritten as:

Following the same argument introduced in [23, 47], it is assumed that the neutral flux density, Γ 0, measured in the sub-divertor region equals the ion flux density perpendicular to the target, Γ ⊥,d . Assuming a Maxwellian distribution function of the neutrals at room temperature and that neutrals are fully recombined into molecules at this temperature, the molecular neutral flux density can be converted to a neutral pressure via the formula Γ 0 = 2 n0 14

(14) In equations 13 and 14, all quantities are expressed in SI units (hence λq is expressed in meters), except for Ip (MA) and PSOL /R geo (MW/m), which is the reason for the factor 10 12 /7 in Eq. 14. The exponents obtained for PSOL /R geo , Ip and ageo are similar to those found with regression analysis, which is remarkable given the simplicity of the two-point model. However, the exponents of p0,div and Bt are somewhat stronger and weaker in magnitude, respectively, than those found in the regression. This discrepancy could stem from additional hidden dependencies of the loss factors on these parameters. Indeed, in DIII-D it was found that the SOL radiative fraction increases as Bt rises at constant current [20]. This behavior, which could be due to the additional SOL volume available due to the increased connection length, would reduce (1 − fpow ) as Bt increases, potentially explaining the stronger negative Bt exponent found in the regression. Similarly, SOL power losses are known to increase with decreasing plasma temperature in the divertor region Td [18, 21] or, equivalently, to increase as the neutral pressure rises [48]. This would cause (1 − fpow ) to decrease when p0,div rises, which, in turn, could explain the smaller positive exponent of p0,div found in the regression. On the other hand, the good agreement found between the two-point model and regression exponents for PSOL /R geo and ageo allows these dependencies to be interpreted more directly. The weak positive dependence on PSOL /R geo can be attributed to the ne, sep 

dependence on the upstream parallel heat flux q|| ,u found in Eq. 6. This relationship can be intuitively understood by considering that ionization is an energy-expensive process; a larger upstream heat flux helps sustain ionizations, thereby increasing the upstream density. Conversely, the negative dependence on ageo found via regression can be mainly attributed to the SOL connection length dependence of ne, sep , as described by Eq. 6. For fixed downstream plasma conditions, a longer L|| increases the upstream temperature due to conduction (see Eq. 4) and, in turn, reduces ne, sep to maintain the pressure 11 balance. Of particular interest for prediction capabilities is the comparison of the multiplicative constant obtained from the two-point model, C2pt , with the device-specific multiplicative constant inferred through regression, Cdev . First, Eq. 14 can be further simplified by introducing a series of additional assumptions. A low-Z impurity, such as boron, is assumed to be the main impurity in the plasma, and an effective ion charge Zeff = 2 is considered. Accordingly, ni/n e = (6 − Zeff )/5 = 0 .8 and zd = zu = 1 .25. Moreover, 

τd = τu = 2 is assumed, which is consistent with experimental measurements [49, 50, 51]. Furthermore, the total sheath heat transmission factor γ is fixed to 7 [52, 53]. With these choices, Eq. 14 can be further simplified as follows:

Cgeo and ˆ κ. In this study, the upstream position is defined as the outer midplane. The fraction of power flowing to the outer target, fout , has been chosen to be 0.5 in C-Mod [54, 55], and 0.65 in AUG and JET [56], following experimental measurements. The values for S/λ q, which in turn set the broadening factor b = 1 + 1 .64 S/λ q, are based on the experimental values found in the ITPA multi-machine database [41]. The power fall-off length λq has been estimated as 2 /7λT , where λT has been evaluated at the separatrix from measurements within the database. The parallel electron conductivity coefficient is given by κe = κz ·2600 W m −1 eV −7/2, where κz = (0 .672+0 .076 √Zeff +0 .252 ·Zeff )−1 is the correction to the electron parallel thermal conductivity introduced by considering an effective ion charge Zeff [10]. The assumption Zeff = 2 .0 yields κe = 2026 W m −1 eV −7/2

for the three devices. Lastly, fpow and fmom have been set to 0.2 and 0, respectively, across the three devices. This choice is motivated by the fact that most of this dataset is unseeded, and, hence, momentum losses could be neglected. The obtained values for 

C2pt are 6.3, 2.2 and 2.9 in C-Mod, AUG and JET, respectively. These values are very 12 close to those found via regression, which is a remarkable result given the large number of simplifications introduced with the two-point model. 

5. Predictive formula and its applicability 

Motivated by the overall good agreement between the regression result and the expectations from the two-point model, a fully predictive formula for ne, sep is proposed, which reads:

The model is able to predict ne, sep within a factor 1.5 across the three tokamaks, a level of fidelity previously unmatched in the literature. 

Figure 5: Experimental ne, sep values against those given by the predictive formula (Eq. 16) for C-Mod (gray circles), AUG (red squares) and JET (blue crosses). Nonetheless, many open questions on ne, sep prediction remain. Firstly, this database encompasses data with similar closed divertor configuration, and it is known that the divertor configuration affects the relationship between ne, sep and divertor parameters, such as Td [21, 57, 58]. Future studies should investigate whether such a complex 2D geometry dependence could be captured by simple models. Secondly, most of the database used in this study is composed of unseeded plasmas, and it is well known that (1) impurity seeding is needed in a power plant to protect the plasma facing components and (2) impurity seeding lowers ne, sep [59, 60, 3], as it reduces the available power to ionize neutrals in the SOL. From the two-point model perspective, impurity seeding will affect the divertor plasma temperature Td and, hence, the divertor neutral pressure. 13 This change, in turn, will impact fpow and fmom , as they are a strong function of 

Td [18, 60, 61, 62]. Future studies should investigate how this complex dynamic could be parametrized in a simple model. Lastly, other interesting open physics questions are how different E ×B drift directions (forward vs. reversed Bt), wall materials (carbon vs. metal) and confinement regimes (H-mode vs. L-mode) impact ne, sep and the proposed formula. 

6. Predictions for ITER, SPARC, DTT, JT60-SA and COMPASS-U 

Keeping in mind the discussion above, projections to next-step devices with similar divertor geometry may be attempted. The tokamaks considered here are ITER [63], SPARC [64], DTT [65], JT60-SA [66] and COMPASS-U [67], five devices expected to start operation within the next decade. Their respective parameters required to predict 

ne, sep are summarized in table 3. For all the parameters, a single value is provided, except for the neutral pressure p0,div , for which a range of values is considered. This is because, for a given scenario, different gas throughput levels could be used, resulting in a range of p0,div and, consequently, ne, sep values. Moreover, the neutral pressure, despite being closely related to tokamak gas balance as discussed in Appendix A, is a quantity that is difficult to predict accurately without knowing the effective pumping speed of the system, which depends on the specific engineering design of the vessel. Given this uncertainty, it is more meaningful to provide a range of neutral pressures for next-step devices, rather than a single precise value. Starting with ITER, the baseline 15 MA, Q=10 inductive H-mode burning plasma discharge is considered [63]. The divertor neutral pressure, αdiv at the outer target and PSOL are chosen to be consistent with recent SOLPS-ITER simulations which include impurity seeding [36, 68, 59]. Although multi-machine scalings predict λq, ITER ∼

1 mm [41], recent turbulent simulations found a widening of λq at ITER-like parameters, reaching ∼ 6 mm [69]. Therefore, following the argument presented in [68], a value of 

λq = 3 .4 mm is adopted. To simplify the analysis, the remaining factors needed in Eq. 15 have been kept constant across most of the tokamaks, with values l∗ = 1 .2, 

κe = 2026 W m −1 eV −7/2, fout = 0 .65, Cgeo = 2 .35, S/λ q = 0 .5 (i.e. b = 1 .82), 

Bd/B u = 1 .4, fpow = 0 .8 and fmom = 0 .5; any deviations from these values are explicitly stated. The last two parameters have been chosen to be consistent with a target electron temperature of Te = 1 eV, according to recent SOLPS-ITER simulations [60]. As this ITER scenario requires a 50–50 deuterium–tritium mixture, an effective ion mass of 

mi = 2 .5 mp is used, where mp is the proton mass. The different fuel mass also enters the calculation of the constant C0 which is equal to 1 .35 ×10 23 for a 50–50 D–T mixture. With these choices, the model predicts ne, sep ,ITER in the range 2.6–4.0 ×10 19 m−3.For SPARC, the Q > 1 H-mode primary reference discharge in lower single null (LSN) configuration is considered [64, 70]. Also in this case, the divertor neutral pressure, 

αdiv at the outer target, PSOL and λq are chosen to be consistent with recent SOLPS-ITER simulations [71, 72, 73]. Given the 50–50 D–T fuel mixture, mi = 2 .5 mp and 14 ITER SPARC DTT JT-60SA COMPASS-U

Table 3: Summary of parameter values used to estimate ne, sep for the ITER Q=10 baseline scenario, the SPARC LSN primary reference discharge, the DTT E1 scenario, the JT-60SA baseline 4–1 scenario and the COMPASS-U high-performance H-mode scenario. 

C0 = 1 .35 × 10 23 are again used. The resulting ne, sep ,SPARC predictions fall in the range 8.9–14 ×10 19 m−3.For DDT, the so-called LSN scenario E1 is modeled [74], using the latest machine design at Rgeo = 2 .19 m [65]. The divertor neutral pressure, αdiv at the outer target, 

PSOL and λq are also chosen to be consistent with recent SOLPS-ITER and DIVGAS simulations [75, 76, 77]. Since this device will operate with deuterium as the main fuel, 

mi = 2 mp and C0 = 1 .51 × 10 23 are employed. The resulting ne, sep ,DTT values predicted by Eq. 16 are in the range 4.7–7.4 ×10 19 m−3.For JT-60SA, the baseline 4–1 scenario foreseen for the OP2 campaign, featuring ITER-like shape and q95 , is considered [78]. The chosen value of PSOL = 20 MW is consistent with realistic levels of installed auxiliary heating power during the OP2 campaign (∼ 25 MW). The divertor neutral pressure, αdiv at the outer target, and λq are in line with recent SOLPS-ITER [79] and SONIC simulations [80]. As in the previous case, the main fuel is deuterium, and therefore mi = 2 mp and C0 = 1 .51 × 10 23 are used. All other parameters are the same as those adopted for the other machines, except for 

Bd/B u which is 1.55 in this case. With these choices, the predicted ne, sep ,JT −60SA values lie in the range 1.6–2.6 ×10 19 m−3.Finally, for COMPASS-U, the high-performance H-mode scenario is considered [67]. Given the similarity between COMPASS-U and C-Mod, many parameters are chosen to be close to those of C-Mod. In particular, the fraction of power going to the outer target is fout = 0 .5 [54], the neutral pressure is taken in the range 1–20 Pa [26] and 

S/λ q = 1 [41]. The SOL power decay length λq is obtained from Brunner’s scaling [81], derived from C-Mod data. Considering deuterium as the main fuel, the predicted 

ne, sep ,COMPASS −U values are in the range 4.1–7.4 ×10 19 m−3.Figure 6 summarizes the model predictions and includes upper and lower bounds 15 Figure 6: Experimental ne, sep values against those given by the predictive formula (Eq. 16) for C-Mod, AUG and JET. Predictions for ITER, SPARC, DTT, JT-60SA and COMPASS-U are overlaid, including also the additional upper and lower boundaries given by the factor 1.5 uncertainty. A range of values is obtained for each device, as a range of input p0,div is considered, see table 3. The symbol indicates one specific operational scenario at a given p0,div (10 Pa for ITER, 3 Pa for SPARC, 4.5 Pa for DTT, 0.5 Pa for JT-60SA and 6 Pa for COMPASS-U). corresponding to the factor of 1.5 uncertainty. Remarkably, despite the simplicity of the model, the ne, sep predictions reported in table 3 are consistent with values obtained from SOLPS-ITER simulations for ITER [36], SPARC [71], DTT [75] and JT-60SA [79]. For COMPASS-U, corresponding SOLPS simulations are not currently available, therefore a comparison is not possible. This agreement allows the model to be used to interpret the observed variation of ne, sep 

across the different tokamaks. The high ne, sep observed in C-Mod and expected in SPARC is primarily driven by their large C2pt , which mainly results from the shallow grazing angle at the outer target and the narrow λq characteristic of these devices. In addition, their relatively small size reduces the connection length, further increasing 

ne, sep . Conversely, larger devices such as ITER, JT-60SA and JET tend to exhibit lower 

ne, sep values. Somewhat counter-intuitively, COMPASS-U is predicted to have lower 

ne, sep than C-Mod, despite their similar size and parameters. This is due to the larger grazing angle at the outer target in COMPASS-U, which reduces C2pt while leaving all the remaining input parameters nearly unchanged. In this respect, a direct comparison of ne, sep between COMPASS-U and C-Mod will be particularly valuable for further validation of the model. 16 7. Conclusions 

In this work, a multi-machine (C-Mod, AUG and JET) H-mode separatrix database is used to derive a scaling expression and to benchmark a physics-based predictive model for the separatrix electron density, ne, sep , requiring only engineering parameters as input. The database encompasses H-mode plasmas that are mainly unseeded, with similar closed divertor configuration, favorable ion B × ∇ B drift direction, and mixed ELM regimes. By analyzing this database, the following conclusions are drawn: (i) The separatrix electron density shows positive dependence on the divertor neutral pressure p0,div and PSOL /R geo , and negative dependence on Bt and ageo , i.e. the machine size. Interestingly, ne, sep is found to be independent of the plasma current, similarly to what has been observed in single-machine studies upon normalization to the neutral pressure dependence [23, 26]. Moreover, device-specific multiplication constants have been derived through regression, with the goal of comparing them to the expectation from a simple model. (ii) A theory-based expression for ne, sep as a function of engineering parameters has been derived by coupling the two-point model equations with simple geometrical formulas. The resulting expression reproduces well both the device-specific multiplication constants and the dependencies on PSOL /R geo , Ip and ageo , which is a remarkable result given the simplicity of the model. On the other hand, the exponents of p0,div and Bt differ somewhat in magnitude from the regression values, suggesting that additional hidden dependencies may be at play. (iii) Motivated by the overall good agreement between the regression results and the expectations from the two-point model, a fully predictive formula for ne, sep is proposed. This formula combines the two-point model multiplicative constant and the regression-based dependencies on p0,div , PSOL /R geo , Ip, Bt and ageo . The model is able to predict ne, sep within a factor 1.5 across the three tokamaks, and provides projections to next-step devices (ITER, SPARC, DTT, JT-60SA and COMPASS-U) that are in agreement with available SOLPS simulations. Despite these encouraging results, this work should be regarded as a first step toward improving our predictive capabilities of ne, sep using reduced, low-fidelity models. To make these predictions more reliable, additional important physics aspects should be taken into account. In particular, it is well known that impurity seeding and the divertor configuration have a significant impact on ne, sep [21, 57, 59, 60]. Future studies should therefore investigate how the complex dynamic introduced by impurities and two-dimensional geometry could be captured within such reduced simple models.

Appendix A. Neutral pressure and tokamak gas balance 

In this appendix, additional considerations on the neutral pressure and its connection to tokamak gas balance are outlined. Considering the tokamak as a large reservoir in equilibrium, the neutral pressure measured at a certain location, p0, is proportional to the gas injection rate, Γ, with the constant of proportionality given by the effective pumping speed, Seff :

p0[P a ] = kB [J/K ] · T [K]

Seff [m3/s ] · Γ[molecules /s ] = 4.14 × 10 −21 

Seff [m3/s ] · Γ[molecules /s ] (17) where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T the neutral temperature. The last step in Eq. 17 has been obtained by considering that neutrals are typically at room temperature (∼ 300 K) at the baratron measurement location. This simplified picture of tokamak gas balance neglects uptake and release of gas by the wall [82, 83, 84], as well as the weak dependence of pumping speed on neutral pressure. Figure 7 shows the experimental relationship between divertor neutral pressure and injected particle flux for the three tokamaks. In AUG and JET, neutral beam injection (NBI) fueling has been neglected, as it is usually one order of magnitude lower than the gas puff. For seeded discharges in AUG, the impurity injected particle flux has also been considered. The colored thick lines indicate the expected neutral pressure for the measured effective pumping speed in the three tokamaks. Experimental data cluster around these expected pressure values, confirming—at a first approximation—the validity of this simplified tokamak gas balance picture. In AUG and JET, the effective pumping speed is set by the cryopump, and is around 20–30 m 3/s in AUG [23] and 120–158 m 3/s in JET [85, 86]. On the other hand, in C-Mod LSN discharges, the effective pumping speed is mainly set by the turbopumps and is expected to be in the range 1–1.35 m 3/s [87]. The upper cryopump installed in C-Mod in 2007 [88] has a negligible impact on gas balance in LSN discharges due to the low pressure in the upper divertor region (about 300 times smaller than the lower divertor pressure). Moreover, in C-Mod, the injected particle flux has been calculated by dividing the time-integrated particle content injected into the vessel by the elapsed time. This approximate calculation is necessary because H-mode C-Mod plasmas are 18 Figure 7: Divertor neutral pressure against the injected particle flux for C-Mod (gray circles), AUG (red squares) and JET (blue crosses). The gray, red and blue thick lines represent the expected pressure for the measured effective pumping speed in C-Mod, AUG and JET, respectively. usually run with a closed gas valve: the feedback control typically closes the valve as soon as the plasma enters H-mode to keep the line-averaged core density constant. This is a typical behavior observed in divertors with no strong particle draining driven by external pumps. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that, to first approximation, the simplified proportionality relation set by the effective pumping speed holds in C-Mod as well. 

Appendix B. SOL power conservation 

In this Appendix, Eq. 3 is derived. The SOL flux-tube area perpendicular to the parallel direction A⊥,SOL is: 

A⊥,SOL = 2 πRd rsin( α) = 2 πRd r

Bp

B , (18) where R is the major radius, dr is the radial width of the flux tube, α is the magnetic field line inclination angle and Bp and B are the poloidal and total magnetic field strength, respectively. Therefore, power conservation along the flux tube from the upstream ‘u’ to the downstream ‘d’ position reads: (1 − fpow )q|| ,uRudr, u

(19) We consider that the upstream radial width of the flux tube is the heat flux decay length at the outer midplane, dr, u = λq, while the target radial width is the integral heat flux decay length multiplied by the magnetic flux expansion, dr, d = λint fx, mag . The magnetic 19 flux expansion is defined as [89]:

Eq. 21 can be intuitively understood by considering that the SOL cross-sectional area of the magnetic flux bundle is inversely proportional to the magnetic field strength (due to magnetic flux conservation under ideal MHD, see e.g. [90]), and that the upstream heat flux is reduced by 1 /b due to the perpendicular diffusion process taking place in the divertor chamber. 

Appendix C. Cylindrical safety factor definitions for non-circular plasma cross-sections 

In this appendix, different definitions of the cylindrical safety factor are compared. Considering a plasma torus with circular poloidal cross-section, the edge safety factor is defined as [91]: 

qcyl ,circ = aB t

R⟨Bp⟩ = 2πμ0

a2Bt

RI p

, (22) with ⟨Bp⟩ = μ0Ip/(2 πa ). This qcyl definition does not take into account the elongated and triangular plasma poloidal cross-sections typically used in many present-day tokamaks. Therefore, to account for the real plasma boundary contour, different versions of Eq. 22 have been introduced in the literature. The qcyl definition adopted in this study follows the approach of Uckan et al. [45, 46] who found that 2 πa geo ˆκ provides a good approximation of the plasma separatrix contour length on the poloidal plane when ITER-like (up-down symmetric) shapes are considered. Accordingly, Eq. 7 can be obtained from Eq. 22 by substituting a with ageo · ˆκ.A second qcyl definition present in the literature is the one adopted by the ITPA confinement database working group, which is given by [92, 93]: 

qcyl ,ITPA = 2πμ0

κaa2geo Bt

Rgeo Ip

, (23) where κa = V / (2 πR geo πa 2geo ) and V is the plasma volume. Additional definitions that have been proposed within the ITPA confinement working group are [94]: 

qcyl ,ITPA ,II = 2πμ0

(LS /2π)ageo Bt

Rgeo Ip

(24) 20 qcyl ,ITPA ,III = 2πμ0

(L/ 2π)2Bt

Rgeo Ip

, (25) where L represents the separatrix contour length (on the poloidal plane) evaluated from the equilibrium reconstruction, while LS = S 

> 2πR geo

is an approximation of L obtained from the plasma surface area S. Comparing the different definitions, Eq. 25 appears to be a good generalization of Eq. 22 for a non-circular plasma cross-section, as it employs an effective minor radius evaluated directly from the equilibrium separatrix contour length. Nonetheless, Eq. 25 (and Eq. 24) have not been adopted in the literature in view of the difficulty of assembling a multimachine database of L and LS .It is useful to compare the qcyl values given by Eq. 7 and Eq. 23 with q95 , which is the quantity that we would like to approximate in this study. In our dataset, qcyl ,ITPA is on average 30 % lower than q95 , whereas Eq. 7 yields qcyl values that are close to q95 within 7 % on average. The main difference between these two definitions is the qcyl dependence on the ‘effective’ elongation: linear in the ITPA definition and squared in Eq. 7. Since the qcyl expression with the squared effective elongation dependence reproduces q95 more accurately, this definition is used in this work. The curious reader might also wonder whether replacing ˆ κ with κa in Eq. 7 leads to any substantial difference in the qcyl values. The effect is very small: when κa is used, the deviation of qcyl from q95 is 6 % on average, compared with a 7 % deviation when ˆ κ is used. This is due to the small discrepancy between ˆ κ and κa, which is 5 % on average. Therefore, the interested reader may replace ˆ κ with κa in the equations derived in section 5 without substantially altering the result.
